Before joining CU, she held a one-year postdoctoral position at Princeton University and a one-year assistant professor position at Stony Brook University.\u00a0Lv's research integrates efficient system design with effective data analysis for the management and exploration of massive data.\u00a0Her research topics include search systems, data mining, mobile systems, social networks\u00a0and data management.\u00a0Her research is\u00a0interdisciplinary in nature and interacts closely with geoscience, renewable and sustainable energy, and environmental science, as well as\u00a0the information needs in people's daily lives.\u00a0Lv has published over 30 papers on peer-to-peer networks,\u00a0large-scale similarity search, mobile air quality sensing, PHEV\u00a0driving study, and cryospheric data analysis, as well as event modeling and\u00a0recommendation in online social communities.\u00a0Her work on large-scale battery system modeling was nominated for the Best Paper Award\u00a0at ISLEPED 2010, and her work on personalized driving behavior analysis has won the\u00a0second prize of Computational Sustainability Awards presented jointly by Pervasive 2012\u00a0and the Computing Community Consortium (CCC). Lv's work has been cited over 2,000 times."]}
