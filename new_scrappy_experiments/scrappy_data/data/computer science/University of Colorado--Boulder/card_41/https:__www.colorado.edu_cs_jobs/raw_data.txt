Candidates must demonstrate a strong commitment to high-quality undergraduate education. We are particularly interested in candidates with a background in the areas of algorithms, databases, software engineering, or programming languages.\u00a0This position is part of the long-term growth plans for the College of Engineering and Applied Science, and we are especially interested in qualified candidates who can contribute, through their research, teaching, and service, to the diversity and excellence of our academic community. Within machine learning, we are particularly interested in candidates who develop novel algorithms and architectures, with potential application areas including, but not limited to, computer vision, robotics, data science, and natural language processing.\u00a0This includes, but is not limited to, a broad swath of topics, including programming language foundations (e.g., type systems, language design), large-scale distributed systems (e.g., cloud computing), secure software (e.g., language-based security), probabilistic programming (e.g., languages for machine learning), automated reasoning (e.g., program analysis, software verification), industrial-scale computing (e.g., software engineering), and computing education research.\u00a0"]}
