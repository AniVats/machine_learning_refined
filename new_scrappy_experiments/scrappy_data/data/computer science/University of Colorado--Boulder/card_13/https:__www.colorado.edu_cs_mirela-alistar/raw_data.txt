Her research focuses around microfluidic biochips, devices that\u00a0enable direct interaction of humans with their microbiome for diagnosis purposes. So far, Mirela\u00a0has built systems based on biochips to serve as personal laboratories: small portable devices that people can own and use to develop customized bio-protocols (\"bio-apps\")."]}
