The team designs and implements novel and practical cyber-physical systems to make physiological sensing less intrusive and expensive. They have partnered with patients at Colorado's Children Hospital and CU School of Medicine to test their systems in the real world. Vu\u2019s research also touches on securing critical cyber-physical systems and providing seamless network connectivity for smart and connected cities."]}
