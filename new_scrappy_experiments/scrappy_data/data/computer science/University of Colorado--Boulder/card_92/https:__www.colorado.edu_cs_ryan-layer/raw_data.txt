Dr. Layer holds B.S. and M.C.S. degrees in computer science from Texas A&M University and a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Virginia. During his graduate studies, Dr. Layer began pursuing projects in the area of computational genomics. He developed two novel algorithms for analyzing large genomic datasets. The\u00a0\u00a0software package characterizes structural variation within populations. These tools are now used to identify pathogenic mutations in many different human diseases. Through innovative software, Dr. Layer enables researchers to find quantitative relationships in massive genomic datasets and better understand disease traits.\u00a0in 2017. His research program will open many avenues for collaboration at the intersection of computer science and genomics. The Layer lab is also affiliated with the Division of Biomedical Informatics and Personalized Medicine at CU Anschutz Medical Campus, as Dr. Layer is dedicated to serving current needs of the medical community and analyzing the latest datasets. As scientists are flooded with sequencing data, Dr. Layer finds meaningful ways to interpret this information and make an impact on human health."]}
