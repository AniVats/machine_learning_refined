She works on trying to capture elements of the meanings of words that can comprise automatic representations of complex sentences and documents. Supervised machine learning techniques rely on vast amounts of annotated training data so she and her students are engaged in providing data with word sense tags, semantic role labels and AMRs for English, Chinese, Arabic, Hindi, and Urdu, both manually and automatically, funded by DARPA and NSF. These methods have also recently been applied to biomedical journal articles, clinical notes, and geo-science documents, funded by NIH and NSF. She is a co-editor of LiLT, Linguistic Issues in Language Technology, and has been on the CLJ Editorial Board and a co-editor of JNLE. She is a past President of the Association for Computational Linguistics, past Chair of SIGLEX and SIGHAN, and was the Director of the 2011 Linguistics Institute held in Boulder, Colorado."]}
