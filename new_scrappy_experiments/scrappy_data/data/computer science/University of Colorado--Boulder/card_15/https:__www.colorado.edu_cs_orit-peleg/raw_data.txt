Peleg used computational techniques to study a wide range of protein interactions, from fibronectin chains and fibers to the dynamic behavior of actin filaments. During postdoctoral work at Harvard University, Peleg became invested in a broad range of biophysics research. She began investigating order and disorder in protein evolution, which progressed to an interest in the organization of insect swarms. Peleg pursues a dynamic line of inquiry, leveraging tools from one discipline to answer questions in another. in 2017 as an assistant professor in the\u00a0Department of Computer Science. Her interdisciplinary research program will open doors for collaboration across multiple departments. Peleg pursues an exciting and unique interface between ecological studies and computational models. She has presented her work at numerous scientific meetings, including the\u00a0\u00a0in 2016. Her research has also been featured on the cover of\u00a0"]}
