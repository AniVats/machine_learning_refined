This research combines novel innovations in machine learning\u00a0and explainable artificial intelligence, providing robots with the ability to learn and generalize skills without programming and to make human-robot teams more powerful than the sums of their parts.\u00a0Prior to joining the CU Boulder faculty, Bradley Hayes spent eight years conducting research on the algorithmic foundations of human-robot interaction at the Yale Social Robotics Lab and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Interactive Robotics Group."]}
