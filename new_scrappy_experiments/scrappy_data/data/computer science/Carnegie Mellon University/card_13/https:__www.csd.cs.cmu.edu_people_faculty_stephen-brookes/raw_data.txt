I believe that proper attention to semantic foundations can yield significant benefits in developing techniques for proving properties of programs, in program design, in language design and implementation.Semantic principles and insights should be used in the design of new programming languages, to avoid the development of cumbersome languages in which the programmer may have to labor to overcome the syntactic quirks and idiosyncrasies of the programming language in order to express his algorithm as a program. I am particularly interested in designing a language that embodies parallelism uniformly: it ought to be as easy to specify parallel expression evaluation as it is to specify parallel execution of statements, and it ought to be easy to put together the results of parallel activities. The choice of an appropriate set of primitives for such a language should be guided by proper attention to semantic foundations, and I am carrying out research on this topic."]}
