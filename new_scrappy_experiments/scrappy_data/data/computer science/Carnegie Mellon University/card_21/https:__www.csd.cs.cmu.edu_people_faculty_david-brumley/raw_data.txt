My research is at the intersection of model checking, formal methods, compilers, and logic, all of which are applied to security problems.\u00a0 Some of the central techniques that we are developing in order to accomplish our goals include efficient symbolic execution, reasoning about bit-level arithmetic in finite fields, sound decompilation, and decision procedures.\u00a0 I also work in other areas of computer security, such as network security and applied cryptography. In these areas, we look at efficient protocols, efficient signature schemes, and privacy-preserving cryptography."]}
