We use computational, mathematical and neurophysiological experimental techniques to study the biological visual system with a view to discovering the secrets of neural computation, advancing computer vision technology and restoring vision to the visually impaired.\u00a0Learning and adaptation are what make biological systems so much more robust and powerful than current man-made vision systems. Our research explores the basic mechanisms and principles underlying adaptation and learning in the visual system at different time scales and at the level of neurons and of neural systems. We have studied theoretically how neurons adapt dynamically to the statistical context of the visual stimuli. We have determined biophysical features in spiking neurons and identified statistical features in natural stimuli underlying neuronal adaptation. We have demonstrated experimentally that the neural machinery of perceptual processing is very flexible and subject to modification by behavioral experience. These works have lead to a new perspective on the functional role of the early visual cortex in vision. We are exploring how these design principles can be used to develop new learning algorithms for learning hierarchical codes and for building the computational structures in our visual systems."]}
