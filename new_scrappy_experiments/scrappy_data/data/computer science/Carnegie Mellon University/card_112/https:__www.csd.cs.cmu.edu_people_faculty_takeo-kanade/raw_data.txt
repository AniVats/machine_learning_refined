Common themes that my students and I emphasize in performing research are the formulation of sound theories which use the physical, geometrical, and semantic properties involved in perceptual and control processes in order to create intelligent machines, and the demonstration of the working systems based on these theories. My current projects include basic research and system development in computer vision (motion, stereo and object recognition), recognition of facial expressions, virtual(ized) reality, content-based video and image retrieval, VLSI-based computational sensors, medical robotics, and an autonomous helicopter.\u00a0\u00a0 Within the Image Understanding (IU) project, my students and I are conducting basic research in interpretation and sensing for computer vision. My major thrust is the \"science of computer vision.\" Traditionally, many computer vision algorithms were derived heuristically either by introspection or biological analogy. In contrast, my approach to vision is to transform the physical, geometrical, optical and statistical processes, which underlie vision, into mathematical and computational models. This approach results in algorithms that are far more powerful and revealing than traditional ad hoc methods based solely on heuristic knowledge. With this approach we have developed a new class of algorithms for color, stereo, motion, and texture.\u00a0\u00a0 While significant advancements have been made over the last 30 years of computer vision research, the consistent paradigm has been that a \"camera\" sees the world and a computer \"algorithm\" recognizes the object. I have been undertaking a project with Dr. Vladimir Brajovic that breaks away from this traditional paradigm by integrating sensing and processing into a single VLSI chip a computational sensor. The first successful example was an ultra fast range sensor which can produce approximately 1000 frames of range images per second an improvement of two orders of magnitude over the state of the art. A few new sensors are being developed including a sorting sensor chip, a 2D salient feature detector (2D winner-take-all circuits), and others.\u00a0\u00a0 The emerging field of Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery strives to develop smart tools to perform medical procedures better than either a physician or machine could alone. Robotic and computer-based systems are now being applied in specialties that range from neurosurgery and laparoscopy to opthalmology and family practice. Robots are able to perform precise and repeatable tasks that would be impossible for any human. The physician provides these systems with the decision making skills and adaptable dexterity that are well beyond current technology. The potential combination of robots and physicians has created a new worldwide interest in the area of medical robotics. We have developed a new computer assisted surgical systems for total hip replacement. The work is based on biomechanics-based surgical simulations and less invasive and more accurate vision-based techniques for determining the position of the patient anatomy during a robot surgery. The developed system, HipNav, has been already test-used in clinical setting."]}
