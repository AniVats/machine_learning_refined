I use the techniques and insights of theoretical computer science to solve problems in programming systems and hardware design that are of practical interest. I have a number of active research projects in these areas that I would be happy to discuss with students. Below are short descriptions of two research projects that I think are particularly exciting.. Logical errors in finite state concurrent systems like sequential circuits and communication protocols are an important problem for computer scientists. They can delay getting a new product on the market or cause the failure of some critical device that is already in use. The most widely used verification method is based on extensive simulation and can easily miss significant errors when the number possible states of the system is very large. Although there has been considerable research on the use of theorem provers, term rewriting systems and proof checkers for verification, these techniques are time consuming and often require a great deal of manual intervention. My group has developed an alternative approach called temporal logic model checking in which specifications are expressed in a propositional temporal logic and an efficient search procedure is used to determine whether or not the specifications are satisfied."]}
