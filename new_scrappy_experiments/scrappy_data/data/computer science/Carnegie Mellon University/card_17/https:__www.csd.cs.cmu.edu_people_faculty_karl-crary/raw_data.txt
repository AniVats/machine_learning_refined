I am particularly interested in the application of types to the structure and implementation of programming languages and software systems.One current focus of my research is on mechanized metatheory. The aim of mechanized metatheory is to give proof of the properties of programming languages (for example, the type safety property says that no well-typed program can crash or otherwise violate its interface) in a form that can be checked by a computer. Not only does this give us greater confidence of the correctness of our proofs, but it also makes it possible for the proof itself to become part of a software system.Another current focus of my research is on the application of certified code to operating systems.\u00a0 Using certified code, we can replace the dynamic protection checks that are ubiquitous in systems today with purely static ones. Since dynamic checks can be unreliable and costly, this can improve the reliability and performance of software systems.\u00a0 Moreover, static checks have greater expressive power than dynamic checks, so they can offer a greater level of protection and security than existing means."]}
