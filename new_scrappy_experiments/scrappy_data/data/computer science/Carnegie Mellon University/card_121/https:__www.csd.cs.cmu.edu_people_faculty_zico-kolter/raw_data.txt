On the application side, my interests range from improving the efficiency of generation, controlling power in smart grids, and analyzing energy consumption in homes and buildings. To attack these problems I focus on techniques from machine learning, reinforcement learning, time series prediction, approximate inference, and convex optimization, amongst others. Some examples of specific projects I am working on include:. Power in the electrical grid is typically viewed as \"unroutable;\" unlike network traffic, for example, power flow must obey fundamental physical laws. This has raised many issues with efficiency (due to line capacity constraints) and economics in power grids, and has largely prevented the adoption of \"CS-style\" networking in power grids. However, recent advancements is power electronics have given us the power to control power flow in local ways. Our research is looking at control and networking methods that would enable arbitrary routing of power in electric grids, offering the potential to transform the smart grid into something that looks much more like computer networks."]}
