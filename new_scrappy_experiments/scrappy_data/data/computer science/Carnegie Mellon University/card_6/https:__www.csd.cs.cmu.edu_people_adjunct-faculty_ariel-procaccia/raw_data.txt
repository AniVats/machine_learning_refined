Specifically, my research interests include, but are certainly not limited to: multiagent systems, computational social choice and preference handling, computational mechanism design and fair division, machine learning, social networks and reputation systems, decision making under uncertainty, and human computation.\u00a0I am augmenting social choice theory using models and techniques from the AI research on decision making under uncertainty to create and analyze new social choice models where preferences can change dynamically."]}
