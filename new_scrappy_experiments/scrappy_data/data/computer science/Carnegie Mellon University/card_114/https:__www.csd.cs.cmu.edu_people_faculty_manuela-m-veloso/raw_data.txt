My long-term research goal is the effective construction of autonomous agents where cognition, perception, and action are combined to address planning, execution, and learning tasks.\u00a0I am interested in adversarial modeling, reuse, and abstraction in control learning for multiple agents. I also continue to investigate effective planning, execution, and learning algorithms for deterministic and nondeterministic multiagent domains within the research projects CORAL (Collaborate, Observe, Resaon, Act, and Learn), MAPEL (Multi-Agent Planning, Execution, and Learning), and the MultiRobot Lab.With my students, I have used robot soccer as a concrete testbed for research. We have developed teams of robot soccer agents in three different leagues that have been RoboCup world champions several times: simulation (1998,1999), CMU-built small-wheeled robots (1997,1998), and Sony four-legged robots (1998).I also research on the integration of planning and information retrieval, and the application of evolutionary computation and machine learning to the performance prediction of signal processing algorithms."]}
