The setting also has numerous applications, like sensor data monitoring, motion capture data, automatic alerts in the 'self-*' PetaByte storage system, chlorine level monitoring on the drinking water, and several more. The emphasis is to develop algorithms that inspect every measurementonly once, and then discard it, since we can not affort to store the huge volume of historical data."]}
