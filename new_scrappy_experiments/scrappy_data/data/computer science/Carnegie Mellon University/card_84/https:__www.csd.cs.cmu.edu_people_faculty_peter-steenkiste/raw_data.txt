My research is very applied: we build prototype systems that incorporate our research ideas and we evaluate these systems using real applications in a realistic setting. I currently have active research projects in the following areas:\u00a0\u2013 The architecture of today\u2019s Internet is more than 30 years old. Of course, the network has changed significantly in terms of scale, technologies, applications, and traffic. An interesting research question is whether we can define a new network architecture that will not only better support today\u2019s Internet, but that can also better support future changes in technology and usage. We have proposed a new architecture, called the eXpressive Internet Architecture or XIA. Within the context of XIA and today's Internet, we are now explore a wide range of networking research topics including congestion control, mobility, network diagnostics, and routing.\u00a0\u2013 Wireless networks have become ubiquitous and most of us use a variety of wireless technologies on a daily if not hourly basis. This rapid growth in usage and deployment, combined with the emergence of new technologies such as smart antennas and software radios, has made wireless an incredibly exciting research area. The wireless networking projects I am involved in cover a wide range of topics including self-managing and self-optimizing wireless deployments, dynamic spectrum access, and vehicular networks."]}
