My specific interest is the application of formal specification and analysis techniques to reason about complex software systems.My current research interests focus on trustworthy computing: reliability, security, privacy, and usability. For many years, I have worked on reliable software; in recent years, I have worked on security. I am now mostly interested in the foundations of security and privacy. Much as we have algorithms, impossibility results, and formal methods for building reliable, distributed systems, I am interested in laying similar kinds of foundations for security and privacy. For security, I seek compositional techniques and properties that allow one to reason locally in order to build large systems with clean interfaces and well-defined behavior. I am now also interested in the technical challenges of privacy, e.g., how to specify and reason about privacy policies, how to determine whether a software system is compliant with a given privacy policy. I am particularly keen on investigating formal logics for reasoning about privacy and applications in healthcare.My past research projects include:"]}
