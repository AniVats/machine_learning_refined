A key goal of this research is to construct electronic marketplaces that are efficient both in terms of the resulting economic allocations and the computational processes. We approach this by developing incentive-compatible market mechanisms and the algorithms that execute those mechanisms efficiently, as well as by designing software agents that act optimally on behalf of the real-world parties that they represent in such markets. A central subject of this research is the deep interaction between the game-theoretic incentive issues and the computational issues that stem from computational limits on the mechanism and the agents. Our research involves theoretical work such as models of limited computation, mechanism design, equilibrium analysis, and algorithm design as well as computational experiments and system building. Many of our systems have been commercially fielded.\u00a0We have developed the market designs and algorithms that run the nationwide kidney exchange at UNOS. Our current research focuses on developing better models and algorithms for the dynamic problem."]}
