Below I briefly describe some of these research directions.. Tremendous progress has been made on this topic in the last two decades, thanks to both algorithmic techniques such as linear and semidefinite programming and metric embeddings, and breakthroughs on the hardness side using the machinery of probabilistically checkable proofs (PCP) and new coding-theoretic, probabilistic, and (Fourier) analytic tools.\u00a0 My own (ongoing) research has made many contributions to this subject using a wide range of techniques, proving strong, and often near-optimal, bounds on the approximability of a broad class of fundamental optimization problems, including constraint satisfaction problems, ranking problems, graph-theoretic problems such as coloring and independent sets, disjoint paths and low-congestion routing, graph partitioning, etc.\u00a0 The power of semidefinite programming and its relation to the Unique Games (and related) problems is an important focus of our current research.combinatorics, cryptography, and high-dimensional geometry.
