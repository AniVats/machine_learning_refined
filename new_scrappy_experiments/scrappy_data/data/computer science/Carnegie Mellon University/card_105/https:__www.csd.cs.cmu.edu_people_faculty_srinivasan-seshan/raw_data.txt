In the past, I have worked on topics such as transport/routing protocol interactions with wireless networks, sensor networking, fast protocol stack implementations, RAID system design, performance prediction for Internet transfers, firewall design, and improvements to the TCP protocol. The following two projects are examples of my current research efforts.\u00a0While the Internet has been a great success and supported a wide range of interesting applications, its design is beginning to show its age. My current research is exploring new network protocols and entire network architectures that address the network's shortcomings and provide better support for the next generation of Internet applications. The eXpressive Internet Architecture (XIA) project is a part of this work that explores a clean-slate redesign of the Internet architecture. The primary goal of the XIA architecture is to create a robust and reliable network that easily supports the evolution of in-network functionality over time. In addition to XIA, my research also explores implications of the fact that video content delivery now dominates all forms of traffic on the Internet and is likely to continue dominating for the foreseeable future. My group is exploring both new protocols, content delivery mechanisms and network management techniques that both address the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities created by this flood of video traffic."]}
