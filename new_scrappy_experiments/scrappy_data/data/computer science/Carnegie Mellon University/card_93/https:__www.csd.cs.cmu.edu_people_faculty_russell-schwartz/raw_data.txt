Most of these differences are in the form of single DNA bases that vary from one person to another, which are called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). My group has worked on models and algorithms to analyze large datasets of SNPs and infer evolutionary trees (phylogenies) and more complex population models that tell us how modern human populations arose from the earliest human ancestors and how our genome has evolved over that time. Our largest area of research in recent years has been the development of similar phylogenetic and population genetic methods to study evolution of cell populations in tumors.In addition to these two core areas, we are involved in many side projects, usually in collaboration with experimentalists. Over the past few years, these projects have included work on modeling biomedical systems, developing more realistic models of biochemistry in the cell, and developing new methods for deconvolving complex genomic data sets from heterogeneous cell populations, primarily with application to cancer genomics. These projects draw on a wide variety of computational tools from discrete algorithms, operations research, applied mathematics, statistics, and machine learning."]}
