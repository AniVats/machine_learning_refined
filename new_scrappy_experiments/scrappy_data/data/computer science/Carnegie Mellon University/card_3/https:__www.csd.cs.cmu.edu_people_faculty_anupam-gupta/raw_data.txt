The goal of this area is to study the structure of metric spaces, and to use this understanding in the design of algorithms for a variety of problems arising on metrics. The approach to expose the inherent structure of metrics is to map the metric into a conceptually \"simpler\" metric that can be used in algorithmic applications in lieu of the original metric; of course, the new simpler metric should resemble the given metric, and hence the map should not distort distances by too much. For instance, if we wanted to solve the travelling salesman problem on a metric space, and we could map the metric into a tree changing the distances by only 10%, then we could solve the TSP on the simpler metric optimally, and this would be within 10% of the optimal solution on the original graph. In recent years, embeddings have become an indispensible tool in the algorithm designer's toolbox, being very powerful and versatile; they have been used for geometric algorithms, finding good graph separators, online algorithms, network design, data structures and many other applications. Despite these successes, many fundamental problems remain open in the area, including understanding how well given metrics can be embedded into Euclidean and other normed spaces; how given data sets can be embedded into low-dimensional spaces without distorting distances substantially; how the topology of graphs interacts with their metric properties, etc. All this research proceeds hand in hand with the algorithmic applications, primarily to providing approximation algorithms for a variety of problems on graphs."]}
