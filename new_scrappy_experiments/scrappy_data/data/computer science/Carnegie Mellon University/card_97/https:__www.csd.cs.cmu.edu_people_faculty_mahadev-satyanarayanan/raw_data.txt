In the course of this work,\u00a0my work has spanned the topics of distributed systems, mobile\u00a0computing, pervasive computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). My 2009\u00a0publication \u201cThe Case for VM-based Cloudlets in Mobile Computing\u201d has\u00a0inspired many technical efforts worldwide at the intersection of\u00a0mobile computing and cloud computing, and has led to the emergence of\u00a0Edge Computing (also known as \"Fog Computing\"). \u00a0\u00a0See my bio (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~satya/bio.html) for examples of my\u00a0past research and impact. \u00a0"]}
