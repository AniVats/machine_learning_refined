These systems include the energy grid, air traffic control, modern automotive/highway systems, and building control and automation systems. These systems are difficult to design in part because they require expertise in many disciplines, such as control theory, physical design, software systems, and distributed systems. In our research we are exploring multi-view design methods, in which different domains of expertise can work with models appropriate to that domain, but the models can be integrated and checked for consistency through shared architectural models. Currently we are working with Toyota on advanced automotive systems involving car-to-highway, and car-to-car communication."]}
