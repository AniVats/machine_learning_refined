My research has addressed a number of approaches to this question, including statistical approaches that find regularities over large numbers of training examples, and analytical approaches that generalize from very few examples and rely instead on prior knowledge and reasoning.Much of my current research focuses around two projects:This is part of a large multi-researcher project to build enduring, personalized, learning assistants for users of computer workstations (like us!).\u00a0 We are working toward a software agent that can understand the user's email, calendar, text files, and actions, and that can learn the user's interests, habits, and tasks, in order to help in a wide range of activities.\u00a0 My specific interest lies in how to make the agent learn.\u00a0 For example, I am currently interested in the question of how the agent can learn to automatically extract information from text emails and files, and how it can learn what threads of activities the user is involved in, when, with whom, about what, etc.\u00a0 This project raises many interesting machine learning questions about learning from labeled and unlabeled data, about learning and statistical language processing, and about cummulative learning over long periods of time."]}
