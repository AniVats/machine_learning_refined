It can also be improved by enriched teacher-student dialog: going beyond just atomic label queries, typical in active learning. For instance, region queries and similarity queries can reduce sample complexity in certain cases.\u00a0 The goal of this research (with Prof. Avrim Blum) is to go well beyond traditional learning from instance-label pairs.\u00a0Proteins are the key building blocks of all living organisms, both in terms of structure and function.\u00a0 They are the components or virtually all biological engines, and the target of most drugs.\u00a0 I have studied how to infer 3D spatial structure from 1D sequences via structural machine learning methods.\u00a0 With Prof Judith Klien-Seetharaman, and I now looking at machine learning methods to induce the host-pathogen (e.g. human-HIV or human-salmonella) protein-protein interaction graph, since pathogens infect hosts via complex protein interactions."]}
