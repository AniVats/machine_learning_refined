One goal of the Scone research is to develop an extensive facility for \"episodic memory\".\u00a0 This can be used both to represent sequences of actions and events and as a source of plans or recipes for a flexible, instructable problem-solver.\u00a0 I am also working with my students to develop a natural-language interface for Scone."]}
