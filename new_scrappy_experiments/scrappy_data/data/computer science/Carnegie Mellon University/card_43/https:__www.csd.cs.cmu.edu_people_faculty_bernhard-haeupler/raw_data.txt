Often I mix this broad and classical area with ideas from distributed computing, information theory, and (network) coding theory. I am always on the lookout for new topics and problems to play with.A common theme in my research is the use of randomness. It is surprising and sometimes almost unbelievable how much simpler and more efficient algorithms can become if allowed to make random decisions."]}
