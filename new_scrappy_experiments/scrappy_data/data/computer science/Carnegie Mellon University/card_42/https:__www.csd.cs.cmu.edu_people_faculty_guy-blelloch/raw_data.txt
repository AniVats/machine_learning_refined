As programming languages become higher level, implementations become more complex, and parallelism becomes pervasive, users are naturally becoming more removed from the hardware and its costs. Rather than trying to bring programmers down to the level of the machine to understand and get good performance, however, I believe that we should be trying to bring languages and cost models up to the level of the programmer. My research therefore centers around questions of how to model costs (e.g. time and space) for very-high level programming constructs (e.g. dynamic parallelism, futures, garbage collection), of how to design systems so these costs have meaning, and of how to make use of these features in effective algorithms design."]}
