I do research on the boundary between computer architecture, computer systems, and programming languages to make computer systems more capable, more reliable, and more efficient. I lead the abstract research group (Here are some of my current research interests:) for a 3 minute overview of our work in this area. We are working to create better software systems and computer architectures that make parallel computing correct, reliable, and efficient. The problem space is especially interesting now with the end of Moore's Law and Dennard Scaling, and the move to crazy heterogeneous parallel systems, approximate computing, distributed system architectures, and emerging (e.g., non-volatile, biological) technology maturing and becoming useful."]}
