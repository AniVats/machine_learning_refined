To accomplish this, we exploit various forms of parallelism through a combination of novel architectural, compiler and operating systems support. In particular, we have been focusing on the opportunities and challenges created by two important VLSI technology trends which are expected to reshape computer systems over the next decade: the potential for single-chip multiprocessing due to higher levels of single-chip integration, and the need to tolerate off-chip latency as the gap between processor speed and the speed of memory and I/O continues to widen."]}
