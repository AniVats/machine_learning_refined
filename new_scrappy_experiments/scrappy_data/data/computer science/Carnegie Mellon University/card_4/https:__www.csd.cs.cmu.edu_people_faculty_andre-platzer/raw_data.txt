The solution to this challenge is the key to enabling computer assistance that we can bet our lives on. My research pursues this challenge with the principled design of programming languages with logic that can provide proofs as correctness guarantees.My research group is pursuing this challenge with three related thrusts:\u00a0and study the use of logics of dynamical systems and their programming languages in formal verification and validation of CPS. This relatively young area is a promising direction for future research, unique in its manifold connections to other pure and applied sciences, including many areas of mathematics, physics, and control theory."]}
