With the remarkable evolution of computer technology, his research interests have been correspondingly evolving. He has been deeply interested in fundamental algorithms and data structures, VLSI computation and layout, and parallel algorithms.Perhaps the most enduring interest has been computational geometry, a spin-off of algorithmic research aimed at the systematic investigation of methods for the most efficient solution of geometric problems. Geometric problems are ubiquitous in human activities. Sporadic, and frequently inefficient, computer solutions had been proposed before, but in the mid-1970s computational geometry emerged as a self-standing discipline targeted at this important area. The goal of computational geometry is to analyze the combinatorial structure of specific problems as the underpinning of efficient algorithms for their solution. The field burgeoned, and in the mid-1980s Prof. Preparata wrote a textbook on the subject that helped establish it in the instructional arena. Today an enormous body of geometric algorithms is known and this knowledge is increasingly indispensable in several applied areas such as geographic information systems, computer graphics, and computer-aided design and manufacturing. Within the last area, Prof. Preparata has also contributed to computational metrology: the assessment of the geometric quality of manufactured parts.", "Computer Science at Brown University\n    Providence, Rhode Island 02912 USA\n    Phone: 401-863-7600\nMap & Directions /\n    Contact Us\n"]}
