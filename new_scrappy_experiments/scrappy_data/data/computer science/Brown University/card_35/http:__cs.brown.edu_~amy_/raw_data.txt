Consequently, AI agents \"artificially intelligent, programmed decision-makers\" must cooperate, compete, and trade with other agents, both human and artificial. This trend drives Amy Greenwald's twin research goals: first, the effort to design and implement AI agents that interact effectively in multiagent environments; second, the effort to understand, explain, and accurately predict the dynamics of such interactions. In pursuing these goals, Prof. Greenwald draws from theoretical and practical sources, including a variety of disciplines such as AI, decision theory, game theory, and economics.", "Computer Science at Brown University\n    Providence, Rhode Island 02912 USA\n    Phone: 401-863-7600\nMap & Directions /\n    Contact Us\n"]}
