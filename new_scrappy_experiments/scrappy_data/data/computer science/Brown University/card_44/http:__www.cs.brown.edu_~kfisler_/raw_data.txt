The research components of this\n  project study the pedagogical techniques and curricular conditions\n  under which knowledge gained through computing transfers back to the\n  host discipline (and vice-versa for teachers)>\n\nI mostly teach courses on programming and programming\n  languages. I have also taught software security, computer-aided\n  verification, and various research seminars.Within Bootstrap, I take the lead on grant writing, research and\n  assessment, and our software infrastructure for producing curricular\n  materials. We all do a bit of everything though, so feel free to\n  reach out if you have a question about the project."]}
