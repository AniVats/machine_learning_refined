My current focus is computing education, with an emphasis on\nhow programming languages impact learning and pedagogy in\ncomputing. I've also worked on\ndiagrammatic logics for hardware design (late 1990s), modular\nverification of feature-oriented programs (early 2000s), and reasoning\nabout access-control and privacy policies (mid-late 2000s). Those\nprojects emphasized formal systems over human reasoning. My work in\ncomputing education tilts the balance, but is part of the same broad\ntheme. </p>\n\n<p>I have been heavily involved in outreach for K-12 computing\n  education since the late 1990s.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"alert\"><font color=\"red\">Information on the new course <a href=\"https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci0111/\">CS0111 (formerly\nCS-A) \u2014 Computing Foundations: Data</a></font></p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<div id=\"buttonbar\">\n  <button class=\"topicbutton\" onclick=\"openTopic('research')\">Research</button>\n  <button class=\"topicbutton\" onclick=\"openTopic('teaching')\">Teaching</button>\n  <button class=\"topicbutton\" onclick=\"openTopic('outreach')\">Outreach</button>\n  <button class=\"topicbutton\" onclick=\"openTopic('professional')\">Professional</button>\n  <button class=\"topicbutton\" onclick=\"openTopic('personal')\">Personal</button>\n</div>\n\n<!-- =============================================== -->\n<div id=\"research\" class=\"topic\">\n\n  <h3>Current Projects</h3>\n\n<div class=\"resproj\"><div class=\"projtitle\">Program Design and Plan\nComposition in Computing Education</div> Programming problems\ntypically contain multiple subtasks, solutions to which must be\nintegrated into a single program. This project explores how novice\nprogrammers decompose problems and compose subtask immplementations.\nOur work emphasizes both the impact of programming languages and\nlibraries on planning behavior, and pedagogies for teaching program\ndesign, planning, and composition.  </div>\n\n<div class=\"resproj\"><div class=\"projtitle\">Cross-Discipline Transfer\n  of Knowledge in Computing Education</div> <a href=\"http://www.bootstrapworld.org\">Bootstrap</a> produces a family\n  of curricula that integrate computing education for middle- and\n  high-school students with other disciplines (such as algebra,\n  physics, and social sciences). The research components of this\n  project study the pedagogical techniques and curricular conditions\n  under which knowledge gained through computing transfers back to the\n  host discipline (and vice-versa for teachers)&gt;\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"resproj\"><div class=\"projtitle\">Notional Machines for\n  Computing Education </div> Notional machines are the abstract\n  machines that programmers are attempting to control when they write\n  programs.  Different programming languages afford different notional\n  machines, which in turn allow different misconceptions about\n  language behavior. We are studying tradeoffs among notional machines\n  and pedagogies for avoiding misconceptions in various CS courses,\n  both intro- and upper-level.  </div>\n\n<h3>Past Projects</h3>\n\n<div class=\"resproj\"> <div class=\"projtitle\">Security Policy\n  Analysis</div> Analysis of Datalog-based policies, such as those used for\n  access-control and privacy.  Our <a href=\"http://www.margrave-tool.org\">Margrave</a> policy analyzer was\n  a SAT-based engine for verifying properties of policies, as well as\n  for verifying and exploring consequences of changes to policies.  We\n  also worked on models of how policies interact with underlying\n  software systems.  </div>\n\n<div class=\"resproj\"><div class=\"projtitle\">Feature-Oriented Software\nVerification</div> Features are cohesive, user-facing behaviors of\nsystems.  Feature-oriented designs (like aspect-oriented design)\nmodularize code around features. Shriram Krishnamurthi and I developed\na theory of compositional verification of feature-based software\ndesigns; our approach generated logical constraints as interfaces on\nfeatures used in open systems (in which not all features were known in\nadvance). </div>\n\n<div class=\"resproj\"><div class=\"projtitle\">Formal Reasoning with\nTiming Diagrams</div> Given a semantics, timing diagrams become a\nformal representation of system behavior. This project explored\nsemantics and analysis techniques for such specifications. I proved\nthat timing diagram verification is decidable, even though timing\ndiagrams capture some non-context-free languages. </div>\n\n</div>\n\n<!-- =============================================== -->\n<div id=\"professional\" class=\"topic\" style=\"display:none\">\n\n  <!--\n<p>Listings available <a href=\"a href=\"Pubs/index-area.html>by\narea</a> or <a href=\"Pubs/index-year.html\">by year</a></p>\n  -->\n\n  <h3>Work and Education History</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li>2017-present: Research Professor and Associate Director of Undergraduate Program in  <a href=\"http://www.cs.brown.edu/\">Computer Science</a>, <a href=\"http://www.brown.edu/\">Brown University </a></li>\n    <li>2014-2017: Professor of <a href=\"http://www.cs.wpi.edu/\">Computer Science</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wpi.edu/\">WPI </a></li>\n    <li>2007-2014: Associate Professor of <a href=\"http://www.cs.wpi.edu/\">Computer Science</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wpi.edu/\">WPI </a></li>\n    <li>2000-2007: Assistant Professor of <a href=\"http://www.cs.wpi.edu/\">Computer Science</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wpi.edu/\">WPI </a></li>\n    <li>1996-2000: Postdoc and Instructor of <a href=\"http://www.cs.rice.edu/\">Computer Science</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rice.edu/\">Rice University </a></li>\n    <li>1997: Summer Intern at IBM Haifa (formal verification group)</li>\n    <li>1991-1996: PhD student in <a href=\"http://www.cs.indiana.edu/\">Computer Science</a>, Indiana University</li>\n    <li>1987-1991: Undergraduate at <a href=\"http://www.williams.edu/\">Williams College</a> (Computer Science and Asian Studies)</li>\n    </ul>\n  \n  <h3>Editorial and Program Committees</h3>\n  \t<ul>\n          <li>Associate Editor: <a href=\"http://toce.acm.org/\">ACM Transactions on\n\t  Computing Education</a>, <a href=\"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=13\">IEEE Transactions on Education</a>\n\n\t  </li><li>Recent Program Committees: <font size=\"-1\"> SIGCSE 2017, <a href=\"http://icer.hosting.acm.org/\">ICER 2016</a>, SIGCSE 2016, <a href=\"http://icer.hosting.acm.org/\">ICER 2015</a>, <a href=\"http://issep15.fri.uni-lj.si/\">ISSEP 2015</a>, <a href=\"http://2014.splashcon.org/track/splash2014-splash-e\">SPLASH-E\n\t  2014</a> (Chair), FOSD 2013, FOSD 2012, ABZ 2012\n\t  <!--, FOSD 2011, SC 2011, FOSD 2010 -->\n\t  </font> </li>\n\n\t  </ul>\n  \n</div>\n\n<!-- =============================================== -->\n<div id=\"teaching\" class=\"topic\" style=\"display:none\">\n\n  <p>I mostly teach courses on programming and programming\n  languages.
