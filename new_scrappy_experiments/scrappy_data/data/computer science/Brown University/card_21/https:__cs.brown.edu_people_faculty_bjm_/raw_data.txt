My focus is creating and using tools for artists. Past work includes\u00a0WYSIWYG NPR, or \"What you see is what you get non-photorealistic rendering.\" In this prototype system, artists draw directly on 3d models to create stylized silhouettes, shading, and decal designs. I also worked on the Accessible Color Project to make color easier to use in graphics programs for both novices and experts. Some of this work resulted in Interactive Color Palette Tools.", "Computer Science at Brown University\n    Providence, Rhode Island 02912 USA\n    Phone: 401-863-7600\nMap & Directions /\n    Contact Us\n"]}
