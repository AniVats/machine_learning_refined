Recent work of Prof. Istrail's research group at Celera Genomics was devoted to algorithmic design and software development for the following areas: genetics of SNPs and haplotypes, high-throughput EST mapping, genomic vaccine design and comparative peptidomics, compu/combichem and protein structure, BLAST-replacement tools, genomic regulatory systems, literature datamining, DNA array design and expression analysis, and theory of games and pharma economic behavior.", "Computer Science at Brown University\n    Providence, Rhode Island 02912 USA\n    Phone: 401-863-7600\nMap & Directions /\n    Contact Us\n"]}
