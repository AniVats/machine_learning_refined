Any recent advances?My research interests span topics traditionally studied in statistics, machine learning, computer vision, and signal processing. Much of my recent work has explored vision systems which segment, recognize, and track objects in complex natural scenes. I believe data-driven, nonparametric Bayesian statistical methods provide a very promising framework to address these problems. My more abstract statistical research is typically inspired by the practical challenges of learning from large, richly structured datasets.I'm excited by the strong links between different departments, and history of interdisplinary research. In machine learning, the best research problems often arise in the most unexpected places!", "Computer Science at Brown University\n    Providence, Rhode Island 02912 USA\n    Phone: 401-863-7600\nMap & Directions /\n    Contact Us\n"]}
