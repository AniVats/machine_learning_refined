Black received his B.Sc. from the University of British Columbia (1985), his M.S. from Stanford (1989), and his Ph.D. in computer science from Yale University (1992). After research at NASA Ames and post-doctoral research at the University of Toronto, he joined the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in 1993 where he later managed the Image Understanding Area and founded the Digital Video Analysis group. From 2000 to 2010 he was on the faculty of Brown University in the Department of Computer Science (Assoc. Prof. 2000-2004, Prof. 2004-2010). He is a founding director at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in T\u00fcbingen, Germany, where he leads the Perceiving Systems department.\u00a0 He is also a Distinguished Amazon Scholar (VP),\u00a0an Honorarprofessor at the University of Tuebingen, and Adjunct Professor at Brown University.\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">Black is a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He is a recipient of the 2010 Koenderink Prize for Fundamental Contributions in Computer Vision and the 2013 Helmholtz Prize for work that has stood the test of time. His work has won several paper awards including the IEEE Computer Society Outstanding Paper Award (CVPR'91). His work received Honorable Mention for the Marr Prize in 1999 and 2005. His early work on optical flow has been widely used in Hollywood films including for the Academy-Award-winning effects in \u201cWhat Dreams May Come\u201d and \u201cThe Matrix Reloaded.\u201d He has contributed to several influential datasets including the <a href=\"http://vision.middlebury.edu/flow/\">Middlebury Flow dataset</a>, <a href=\"http://humaneva.is.tue.mpg.de/\">HumanEva</a>, and the <a href=\"http://sintel.is.tue.mpg.de/\">Sintel dataset</a>. Black has coauthored over 200 peer-reviewed scientific publications.\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">He is also active in commercializing scientific results, is\u00a0an inventor on 10 issued\u00a0patents, and has advised multiple startups. He uniquely combines computer vision, graphics, and machine learning to solve problems in the clothing industry.\u00a0In 2013, he\u00a0co-founded\u00a0Body Labs Inc., which used computer vision, machine\u00a0learning, and graphics technology licensed from his lab to commercialize \"the body as a digital platform.\"\u00a0 Body Labs was\u00a0acquired by Amazon\u00a0in 2017.\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">Black's research interests in machine vision include optical flow estimation, 3D shape models, human shape and motion analysis, robust statistical methods, and probabilistic models of the visual world. In computational neuroscience his work focuses on probabilistic models of the neural code and applications of neural decoding in neural prosthetics.", "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOur goal is to understand the principles of Perception, Action and Learning in autonomous systems that successfully interact with complex environments and to use this understanding to design future systems\n\t\t\t\t\t", ""]}
