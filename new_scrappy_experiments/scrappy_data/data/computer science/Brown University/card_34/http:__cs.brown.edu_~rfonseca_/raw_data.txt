In these\n                scenarios it becomes increasingly difficult to understand how a system behaves, and, especially, how and why it\n                fails. Causal tracing is a technique that captures the causality of events across all of these components,\n                layers, and machines, and eases the task of understanding complex distributed systems. There are a multitude\n                of causal tracing systems and frameworks, including many research and industry projects. Examples include our own\n                ", ""]}
