This is an interest that I developed as a result of spending the 2009-2010 academic year in the U.S. Department of State as a Jefferson Science Fellow. Over the last decade I have also done research and published on computational nanotechnology, the I/O efficiency of multicore chips, and coded computation. The latter involves adding redundancy to data so that if errors occur during a computation, they can be corrected.", "Computer Science at Brown University\n    Providence, Rhode Island 02912 USA\n    Phone: 401-863-7600\nMap & Directions /\n    Contact Us\n"]}
