We are undertaking a number of\nprojects directed at this goal.  These include:\n  ", "Our research here addresses the logical confluence of web services, peer-to-peer computing, grid computing, open source, autonomic computing, and software components. When all of these take off together, all programs share data, computation, and code, and one is left with a world where there is effectively only one program and it is running everywhere and all the time. Our research here is focused on the many issues that will arise as we move to such a world: how to define components, how to integrate privacy and security, dealing with failure as an integral part of all programs, economic and social issues, and frameworks for programming at the appropriate scale and level. As a demonstration program here, we have implemented a suite of tools that provide visualization of what is currently being viewed on the web by category. ", ".
