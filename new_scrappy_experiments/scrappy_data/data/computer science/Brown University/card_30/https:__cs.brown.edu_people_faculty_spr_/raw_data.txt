He is particularly interested in software tools and environments. He has developed a series of powerful programming environments and tools, including PECAN, GARDEN, FIELD, DESERT and, most recently, CLIME. PECAN demonstrated the power of workstations and multiple views in the early 1980s. GARDEN demonstrated the utility of visual languages in a multilingual conceptual framework. FIELD pioneered the concept of message-based (control) integration and illustrated a variety of program visualizations. It was highly successful and formed the basis (either conceptually or literally) for most UNIX programming environments in the 1990s. DESERT combined control integration, an inexpensive data-integration mechanism, and a common editor based on Framemaker to produce a comprehensive programming and design environment. CLIME used constraints and model checking techniques to manage software evolution and check statically for programming problems.", "Computer Science at Brown University\n    Providence, Rhode Island 02912 USA\n    Phone: 401-863-7600\nMap & Directions /\n    Contact Us\n"]}
