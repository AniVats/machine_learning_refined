My research involves\n      connections between computer vision and artificial\n      intelligence to a variety of areas including combinatorial optimization,\n      stochastic models, machine learning, and natural language processing.\n<h4>\n<a href=\"papers.html\">Papers</a><br/>\n<a href=\"talks.html\">Talk slides</a><br/>\n<a href=\"code.html\">Code</a><br/>\n<a href=\"students.html\">PhD Students</a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/pff000/designs\">3D printing</a><br/>\n</h4>\n<hr/>"]}
