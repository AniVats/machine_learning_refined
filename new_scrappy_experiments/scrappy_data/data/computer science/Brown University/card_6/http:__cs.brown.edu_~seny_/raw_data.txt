Before joining Brown, I was a researcher at\n<a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com\">Microsoft Research</a> (Redmond Lab).\nMy research is in cryptography and is driven by real-world problems from\nprivacy, security and surveillance. My primary focus is on the design and\ncryptanalysis of encrypted algorithms, which are efficient algorithms that\noperate on end-to-end encrypted data.  I maintain interests in various aspects\nof theory and systems, including applied and theoretical cryptography, data\nstructures and algorithms, data systems, algorithmic fairness, game theory and\ntechnology policy.\nI direct the <a href=\"http://esl.cs.brown.edu/\">Encrypted Systems Lab</a> and am\naffiliated with the <a href=\"http://caps.cs.brown.edu/\">CAPS</a> group, the <a href=\"https://www.brown.edu/initiatives/data-science/home\">Data Science\nInitiative</a>  and the\n<a href=\"https://watson.brown.edu/chrhs/\">Center for Human Rights and Humanitarian\nStudies</a>.\nIf you are interested in working in the Encrypted Systems Lab, please read <a href=\"https://cs.brown.edu/people/seny/contact/\">this</a> before sending me an email."]}
