He is particularly interested in applications of probability theory and combinatorics to this area. Randomness comes up in two aspects of the study of algorithms: randomized algorithms and probabilistic analysis of algorithms. Randomized algorithms are algorithms that make random choices during their execution. In many cases the randomized algorithms are more efficient, simpler and easier to program than their deterministic counterparts. Probabilistic analysis of algorithms attempt to characterize the average-case performance of algorithms on typical inputs. This issue is important in computation problems for which there are no efficient solutions for all possible inputs.", "Computer Science at Brown University\n    Providence, Rhode Island 02912 USA\n    Phone: 401-863-7600\nMap & Directions /\n    Contact Us\n"]}
