Any recent advances?Most of my research is in computer graphics, especially in informal modes of input and output. I'm interested in sketching as means to describe shape, and in expressive (rather than photorealistic) renderings as a way to communicate information to the viewer. But in general, I'm fond of any topic with enough mathematics in it. I've recently become interested in machine learning.It's great that students here have such wide-ranging interests.", "Computer Science at Brown University\n    Providence, Rhode Island 02912 USA\n    Phone: 401-863-7600\nMap & Directions /\n    Contact Us\n"]}
