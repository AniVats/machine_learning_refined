robots \nthat are generally capable in a wide variety of tasks\nand environments. \n\n\nI focus on understanding how to\ndesign agents that learn \nabstraction hierarchies that enable fast, goal-oriented planning.\nI develop and\napply techniques from machine learning, reinforcement learning, optimal control and planning\nto construct well-grounded hierarchies that result in fast planning for common cases,\nand\nare robust to uncertainty at\nevery level of control.\n\n\nI believe that it will take advances in all of these areas, and additionally advances in how to <i>integrate</i> these areas,\nto solve the AI problem.\n\n\nThis video of some of my recent work is a good indicator of my interests - it combines ideas from\nhierarchical reinforcement learning, probabilistic machine learning, task-level planning, and robotics\nto create a robot that autonomously learns an abstract symbolic model of an environment and then uses it to plan:\n<center>\n<iframe
