With the advent of data-hungry representation\n\t\tlearning techniques like deep neural networks, curating labeled training data has\n\t\treplaced feature engineering as the most expensive and time consuming task in machine\n\t\tlearning. Weak supervision aims to overcome this bottleneck. I also work on statistical\n\t\trelational learning and information extraction.\n\t"]}
