Our researchers conduct both theoretical and systems research in big data management, cloud computing, data pricing, probabilistic databases, stream processing, sensor-based monitoring, databases and the web, XML, data management for ubiquitous computing, data integration, and data mining. The group frequently works with colleagues in , as well as researchers in other disciplines across the campus. focuses on enhancing people's ability to understand and communicate data. Our researchers develop new, interactive systems for data visualization and analysis in order to improve the efficiency and scale at which experts work, and to lower barriers for non-experts to make the most effective use of their data. Ongoing projects include the development of new languages, scalable systems and design tools for interactive visualization. and visual analysis systems for domains ranging from large-scale text analysis to population genomics.\n\nFor more information on our data science research and expertise, read about UW CSE's campus-wide leadership in honored for contributions to data management research"]}
