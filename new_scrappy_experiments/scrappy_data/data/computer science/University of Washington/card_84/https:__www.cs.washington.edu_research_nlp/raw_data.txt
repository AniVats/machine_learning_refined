Our research is highly collaborative: we regularly work with researchers across the UW campus including many other computer scientists, computational linguists, speech researchers, and social scientists. We also engage a wide range of industry partners like the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Microsoft Research, Google, Facebook, and Intel. in this exciting research environment!UW CSE researchers win Best Paper Award at EMNLP 2016"]}
