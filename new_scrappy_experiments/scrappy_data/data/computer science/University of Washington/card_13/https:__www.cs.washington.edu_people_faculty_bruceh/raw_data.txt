After a series of digital signal processing projects for various audio companies, I decided that the world really did need yet another audio company, so I co-founded a Seattle high-end digital audio firm in 1993. After pushing digital audio bits through DSPs for nine years and manufacturing audio gear for Hollywood, I decided enough really was enough and left to pursue other interests. That brought me back to mystifying undergraduates again."]}
