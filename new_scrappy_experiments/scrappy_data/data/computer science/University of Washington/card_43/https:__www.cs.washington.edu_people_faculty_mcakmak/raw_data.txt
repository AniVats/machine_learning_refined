The goal of my research is to enable end-users of general-purpose personal robots to program new capabilities on their robots. In particular, I am interested in PbD in which users can achieve this by providing demonstrations of what they want. My work investigates challenges faced by potential users of such programmable robots and develops interaction mechanisms, learning algorithms and interfaces to make PbD more efficient and effective. My Ph.D. thesis develops mechanisms for guiding users during PbD interactions, such as teaching instructions or questions asked by the robot."]}
