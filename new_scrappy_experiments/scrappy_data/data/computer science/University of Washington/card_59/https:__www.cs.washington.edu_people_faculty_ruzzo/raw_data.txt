Of particular interest is the use of\ntriple-expansion bypass valves, coupled to individual governors\non each engine, to achieve write-synchronization of the\nmachines.  Graduate students have played an important role in\nthe construction and operation of the engine, particularly in\nstoking the boilers, and advanced undergraduates are\noccasionally allowed to polish the brass gauges."]}
