I see myself as a generalist -- I am attracted to the biggest problem I can find, regardless of area. My most recent work has been in the area of improving the performance and reliability of data center operating systems, networks, and distributed systems.  I've also done research in programming languages, software engineering, system security, file systems, computer architecture, and educational software. "]}
