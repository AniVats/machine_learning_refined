In particular, she has been spearheading the development and analysis of tensor algorithms for machine learning. Tensors are multi-dimensional extensions of matrices and can encode higher order relationships in data. At Amazon Web Services, she is building AI services at all levels of\nthe stack.\n          She is the recipient of several awards such as the Alfred. P. Sloan Fellowship, Microsoft Faculty Fellowship, Google research award, ARO and AFOSR Young Investigator Awards, NSF Career Award, Early Career Excellence in Research Award at UCI, Best Thesis Award from the ACM Sigmetrics society, IBM Fran Allen PhD fellowship, and several best paper awards.  She received her B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from IIT Madras in 2004 and her PhD from Cornell University in 2009. She was a postdoctoral researcher at MIT from 2009 to 2010, an assistant professor at U.C. Irvine between 2010 and 2016, a visiting researcher at Microsoft Research New England in 2012 and 2014, a Principal Scientist at Amazon Web Services since 2016 and a Bren professor at Caltech since 2017.\n          -->\n<p align=\"justify\">\n\n          Anima Anandkumar holds dual positions in academia and industry. She is a Bren professor at Caltech <a href=\"http://www.cms.caltech.edu/\">CMS</a> department and a director of machine learning research at <a href=\"https://research.nvidia.com/person/anima-anandkumar\">NVIDIA</a>.  At NVIDIA, she is leading the research group that develops next-generation AI algorithms. At Caltech, she is the co-director of Dolcit and co-leads the <a href=\"http://www.ist.caltech.edu/ai4science/\">AI4science</a> initiative, along with Yisong Yue. \n\n          <br/>She has spearheaded the development of tensor algorithms, first proposed in her <a href=\"http://jmlr.org/papers/volume15/anandkumar14b/anandkumar14b.pdf\">seminal paper</a>. They are central to effectively processing multidimensional and multimodal data, and for achieving massive parallelism in large-scale AI applications. \n\n          <br/>Prof. Anandkumar is the youngest named chair professor at Caltech, the highest honor the university bestows on individual faculty. She is recipient of several awards such as the Alfred. P.
