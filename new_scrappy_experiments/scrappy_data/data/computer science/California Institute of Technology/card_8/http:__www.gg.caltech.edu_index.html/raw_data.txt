New methods are needed to increase\nmodeling fidelity, ``fluency,'' and interactivity. This is\naccomplished using mathematical principles from differential\ngeometry, constrained optimization, integral equations and piecewise\ndifferential equations, as well as physical principles such as the\nmechanics of solids and the physics of light.
