Layered architectures such as brains integrate high level planning with fast lower level sensing, reflex, and action and facilitate learning, adaptation, augmentation (tools), and teamwork, despite being implemented in energy efficient hardware with sparse, quantized, noisy, delayed, and saturating sensing, communications, computing, and actuation, on time scales from milliseconds to minutes to days.\u00a0 We are developing a mathematical framework that deals with all of these features and constraints in a coherent and rigorous way with broad applications in science, technology, ecology, and society.\n<h3>List of Research Areas</h3>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Universal law and architectures in complex tech, bio, neuro, eco, and social networks.\u00a0 Integrating math of control, computing, communications, and multiscale physics.\n<!-- Related News link -->"]}
