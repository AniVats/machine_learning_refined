The first half of the course will use familiar case studies to motivate a new mathematical framework for understanding these similarities and differences, emphasizing layering, dynamics, optimization, nonlinearity, learning, communications, and control, sparsity and structure, and tradeoffs between robustness, efficiency, and evolvability.  Lectures will primarily be by video with class time devoted to discussions and lots of live demos and games involving audience participation. The second half of the term will be a fast review of core theory in robust and optimal control and a bit of nonlinear using SOSTOOLS. \n"]}
