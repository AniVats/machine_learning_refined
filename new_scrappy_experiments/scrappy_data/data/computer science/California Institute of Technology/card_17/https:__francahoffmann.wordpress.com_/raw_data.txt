For a one hour seminar about my PhD research, click My research interests lie at the interface of model-driven and data-driven approaches.I believe that it is not just about what mathematical analysis can do for applications, but also what applications can do for mathematics. Applications that benefit from a PDE approach often generate new questions giving rise to novel mathematical theories, and thus providing insights not just for the application at hand, but also enabling to push boundaries in seemingly unrelated fields. I am interested in how PDE techniques can be employed to answer modeling questions across different scales, disciplines and applications. For more details about my research, have a look\u00a0"]}
