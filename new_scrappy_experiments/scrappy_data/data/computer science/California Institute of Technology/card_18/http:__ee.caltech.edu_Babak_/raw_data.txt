{"email": [], "image": [], "research_blurb": ["\nMy research is in communications, signal processing, and control. I am\ncurrently most interested in wireless networks and in genomic signal\nprocessing. In the wireless network area I study modeling issues,\ninformation-theoretic questions, scheduling, protocols, various\nperformance criteria, etc. In the\ngenomic signal processing area I have been studying real-time DNA\nmicroarrays, a novel technology that we have developed. My earlier\nwork includes: multi-antenna systems (e.g., space-time codes);\nefficient decoding algorithms in communications; adaptive signal processing \nand neural networks; blind channel equalization; statistical signal \nprocessing; robust estimation and control, especially connections \nbetween robustness and adaptation; and linear algebra, with emphasis on \nfast algorithms, random matrices and group representation theory. I\nretain a keen interest in all these.\n"]}
