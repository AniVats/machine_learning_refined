Robert made seminal contributions to the emerging disciplines of molecular programming and dynamic nucleic acid nanotechnology, providing the first experimental demonstration of conditional nucleic acid self-assembly, and developing computational algorithms that enable researchers around the world to analyze and design programmable molecular systems. Robert was brilliant, fun-loving, creative, and generous; he was a model scientist, collaborator, and friend.  We will miss him and always remember him with fondness and respect and gratitude.\n</div>\n<div class=\"force_float_wrap\"></div>\n</div>\n\n        Engineering programmable molecular instruments for reading out and regulating the state of endogenous biological circuitry within intact organisms\n      "]}
