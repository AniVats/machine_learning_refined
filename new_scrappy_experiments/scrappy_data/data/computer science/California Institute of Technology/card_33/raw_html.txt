Bruno</a></strong>\n<p>\n<strong>\nProfessor of Applied and Computational Mathematics\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Prof. Bruno's work focuses on development of accurate, high-performance numerical PDE solvers capable of modeling faithfully realistic scientific and engineering configurations. Major theoretical and computational difficulties arise in associated areas of PDE theory, numerical analysis and computational science as a result of intricate and/or singular geometries as well as solution singularities, resonances, nonlinearities, high-frequencies, dispersion, etc. Recently developed Fourier Continuation (FC) and integral-equation techniques, which can successfully tackle such challenges, have enabled accurate solution of previously intractable PDE problems of fundamental importance in science and engineering.</p>\n<a href=\"http://www.caltech.edu/~obruno\">Personal Page</a>\n</div>\n</div>"
