You can install\n    the prototype using the eclipse install link: <center><tt>http://www.countablethoughts.com/eclipse-viz/site.xml</tt></center>\n<!--\n    Research projects I have worked on in the past (and, for some, am still working on) include:\n    <ul>\n        a programming language and compiler for teaching introductory discrete mathematics (Setty),\n        improving submission, annotation, review, and feedback of proofs (ColorMyGraph and \"Whiteboard\"),\n        using abstract interpretation to help students learn (output and time complexity analysis of programs),\n        peer grading of proofs (verifications),\n        studying the effects and implementation of formative assessment, and\n        modifying production compilers to help students learn.\n    </ul>\n\n\n    More details can be found in my <a class=\"pdf\" href=\"/documents/ResearchStatement.pdf\">research statement</a>\n    and/or my <a href=\"http://reports-archive.adm.cs.cmu.edu/anon/2014/CMU-CS-14-114.pdf\">Master's Thesis</a>.\n    -->\n\n<!-- <h2>Lectures</h2>\n<div class=\"level_one\">\n    Below is <b>a sampling</b> of some lectures I've given in the past. In many of the classes I have taught, the lecture slides have served\n    as course notes, and I often use \"pauses\", in which partial slides appear during the lecture. The versions below have all the \n    pauses removed for easier offline reading. I have many more lectures on similar topics, and they are available by request. If you \n    read any of these, and find them useful, please send me e-mail!  I'd love to hear from you!\n\n    <a class=\"pdf\" href=\"/lectures/151/functions.pdf\">Functions</a>.\n    This is another 15-151 lecture which motivates and discusses various important function properties.  For fun: \n    <a class=\"pdf\" href=\"/N\">&#8469;</a>\n    <a class=\"pdf\" href=\"/Z\">&#8484;</a>\n    <a class=\"pdf\" href=\"/E\">&#120124;</a>\n    <a class=\"pdf\" href=\"http://un.countablethoughts.com/R\">&#8477;</a>\n    <a class=\"pdf\" href=\"http://un.countablethoughts.com/F:N->[0-9]\">F:N->[0-9]</a>\n\n    <a class=\"pdf\" href=\"/lectures/151/asymptotic_analysis.pdf\">Asymptotic Analysis</a>.\n    This is, yet again, another 15-151 lecture that motivates asymptotic notation, gives examples of the \"tree method\", and\n    derives the merge sort recurrence.\n\n    <a class=\"pdf\" href=\"/lectures/fsms.pdf\">Finite State Machines</a>.\n    This is a 15-251 (guest) lecture that discusses Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs).  It uses turing machines and regular\n    expressions as motivation.\n\n    <a class=\"html\" href=\"/stego\">LSB Steganography</a>.\n    This is a lecture to an introductory CS class that introduces binary representation, image representation, very basic steganography, \n    and the PPM file format.  It includes a PDF of the lecture, a ZIP of stubs in Java, and some sample images in PPM to decode.\n\n -->\n<!-- <h2>Presentations</h2>\n<div class=\"level_one\">\n    Here are <b>some</b> presentations I've given to various audiences.\n    <a class=\"pdf\" href=\"/presentations/setty.pdf\">Setty: A Mathematical Programming Language</a>.\n    This is a short presentation which describes the language Setty that I designed, why I designed it,\n    my research goals for it, and runs through some sample exercises one might present to students.\n    <a class=\"pdf\" href=\"/presentations/TeachingTheory.pdf\">Teaching Reasoning and Proofs</a>.\n    This is a seminar I have given several times to an audience of teaching assistants for a variety\n    of theory and proof-based courses.  Much of the content (and answers to the questions) are missing\n    from the presentation, because I said it out loud, but I'm happy to answer any questions via e-mail.\n\n -->"]}
