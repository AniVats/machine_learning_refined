My teaching drives everything\n    that I do, and I love to try new techniques to help students learn in my courses.  My research involves using\n    <b>technology</b>, <b>machine learning</b>, <b>human computation</b>, and <b>collaboration</b> to improve the \n    way that we <b>teach</b> computer scientists at the collegiate level.  \n\n\n    </p><p>As of January 2018, here's my <a class=\"pdf\" href=\"/documents/TeachingStatement.pdf\">teaching statement</a>\n    and <a class=\"pdf\" href=\"/documents/cv.pdf\">CV</a>.\n    </p><p>I can be reached via e-mail at blank@caltech.edu.\n</p></div>\n\n            <h2>Meeting with Me</h2>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: -15px\"></div>\n<div class=\"level_one\">\n    <p>Feel free to stop in whenever my door is open; I'm happy to meet with students whenever I have free time.\n    <span id=\"proximity\"></span></p>\n\n    <p>When requesting a private meeting with me, please make sure to explain in as much detail as possible why you are requesting it.  \n    I'll do my best to accommodate as many students as I can, but it's important for me to remember why I'm meeting with you.</p>\n\n    <p>If you are currently (or previously) in one of my courses, and you would like to discuss <i>anything</i> (the course, advice, life, well-being), please use\n    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blank.vyte.in/meet/10\">this website</a>. \n\n    </p><p>If you would like to meet with me to discuss working with me on one of my (or your!) projects, please use  \n    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blank.vyte.in/meet/15\">this website</a>. \n\n    </p><p>If you would like to meet with me to request a recommendation, please read <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://countablethoughts.com/recommendation\">this website</a>.\n</p></div>\n\n            <h2>Documents</h2>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: -15px\"></div>\n<div class=\"level_one\">\n    <p><a class=\"pdf\" href=\"/documents/HowToLaTeX.pdf\">LaTeX Tutorial</a> (and the accompanying \n    <a class=\"pdf\" href=\"/documents/homework-anon.tex\">homework template</a>).\n    Many of the courses I've worked on have required that students submit their solutions using LaTeX; so, I wrote \n    a short tutorial which also acts as a LaTeX reference.\n\n    </p><p><a class=\"pdf\" href=\"/documents/TAAdvice.pdf\">Advice for new TAs</a>.\n    Back when I was TAing, I found that many first-time TAs had no idea what to expect.

It offers advice for new TAs who want an idea of what pitfalls to avoid.\n\n    </p><p><a class=\"pdf\" href=\"/documents/HowToAskForHelp.pdf\">How to ask for help</a>.\n    I've found a really common issue for freshmen is that they get stuck for the very first time, and they aren't sure how\n    to get help.  This document outlines ways in which students can turn \"getting stuck on homework\" into a positive experience.\n</p></div>\n\n            <h2>Research</h2>\n<div class=\"level_one\">\n    I am currently working on semi-automating proof grading by making an online proof editor which can be used to collapse equivalence classes of proofs together. \n    <br><br>\n    I am also working on a visualizer for introductory Java programming courses that demonstrates recursion and references effectively.  You can install\n    the prototype using the eclipse install link: <center><tt>http://www.countablethoughts.com/eclipse-viz/site.xml</tt></center>\n    <!--\n    Research projects I have worked on in the past (and, for some, am still working on) include:\n    <ul>\n        <li>a programming language and compiler for teaching introductory discrete mathematics (Setty),</li>\n        <li>improving submission, annotation, review, and feedback of proofs (ColorMyGraph and \"Whiteboard\"),</li>\n        <li>using abstract interpretation to help students learn (output and time complexity analysis of programs),</li>\n        <li>peer grading of proofs (verifications),</li>\n        <li>studying the effects and implementation of formative assessment, and</li>\n        <li>modifying production compilers to help students learn.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n\n    More details can be found in my <a class=\"pdf\" href=\"/documents/ResearchStatement.pdf\">research statement</a>\n    and/or my <a href=\"http://reports-archive.adm.cs.cmu.edu/anon/2014/CMU-CS-14-114.pdf\">Master's Thesis</a>.\n    -->\n</div>\n\n            <!-- <h2>Lectures</h2>\n<div class=\"level_one\">\n    Below is <b>a sampling</b> of some lectures I've given in the past. In many of the classes I have taught, the lecture slides have served\n    as course notes, and I often use \"pauses\", in which partial slides appear during the lecture. The versions below have all the \n    pauses removed for easier offline reading. I have many more lectures on similar topics, and they are available by request. If you \n    read any of these, and find them useful, please send me e-mail!  I'd love to hear from you!\n\n    <p><a class=\"pdf\" href=\"/lectures/151/functions.pdf\">Functions</a>.\n    This is another 15-151 lecture which motivates and discusses various important function properties.

It uses turing machines and regular\n    expressions as motivation.\n\n    <p><a class=\"html\" href=\"/stego\">LSB Steganography</a>.\n    This is a lecture to an introductory CS class that introduces binary representation, image representation, very basic steganography, \n    and the PPM file format.  It includes a PDF of the lecture, a ZIP of stubs in Java, and some sample images in PPM to decode.\n</div>\n -->\n            <!-- <h2>Presentations</h2>\n<div class=\"level_one\">\n    Here are <b>some</b> presentations I've given to various audiences.\n    <p><a class=\"pdf\" href=\"/presentations/setty.pdf\">Setty: A Mathematical Programming Language</a>.\n    This is a short presentation which describes the language Setty that I designed, why I designed it,\n    my research goals for it, and runs through some sample exercises one might present to students.\n    <p><a class=\"pdf\" href=\"/presentations/TeachingTheory.pdf\">Teaching Reasoning and Proofs</a>.\n    This is a seminar I have given several times to an audience of teaching assistants for a variety\n    of theory and proof-based courses.  Much of the content (and answers to the questions) are missing\n    from the presentation, because I said it out loud, but I'm happy to answer any questions via e-mail.\n</div>\n -->\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"right\">\n            <div id=\"office-hours\">\n                <h2>Office Hours</h2>\n                <ul class=\"office-hours\">\n                    <li><div class=\"day\">Monday:</div>4:00pm<div class=\"to\"></div>6:00pm</li>\n                    <li><div class=\"day\">Thursday:</div>6:00pm<div class=\"to\"></div>8:00pm</li>\n                    <li><div class=\"day\">Friday:</div>7:00pm<div class=\"to\"></div>9:00pm</li>\n                </ul>\n            </div>\n            <div id=\"courses\">\n                <h2>Courses <a style=\"text-decoration: none\" href=\"/courses.html\">(+)</a></h2>\n                <div class=\"semester\">Fall 2019 (Caltech)</div>\n<div class=\"courses\">\n    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs24/19fa/\">CS 24: Introduction to Computing Systems</a>\n    <div class=\"role\">(<i>Instructor</i>)</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"courses\">\n    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/interviews/\">CS 11: Interview Preparation Track</a>\n    <div class=\"role\">(<i>Instructor</i>)</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"semester\">Spring 2019 (Caltech)</div>\n<div class=\"courses\">\n    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs3/19sp/\">CS 3: Introduction to Software Design</a>\n    <div class=\"role\">(<i>Instructor</i>)</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"courses\">\n    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs24/19sp/\">CS 24: Introduction to Computing Systems</a>\n    <div class=\"role\">(<i>Co-Instructor</i>)</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"semester\">Winter 2019 (Caltech)</div>\n<div class=\"courses\">\n    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs2/19wi/\">CS 2: Introduction to Programming Methods</a>\n    <div class=\"role\">(<i>Instructor</i>)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"semester\">Fall 2018 (Caltech)</div>\n<div class=\"courses\">\n    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs37/18fa/\">CS 37: Algorithms in the Real World</a>\n    <div class=\"role\">(<i>Instructor</i>)</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"courses\">\n    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs9/18fa/\">CS 9: Introduction to Computer Science Research</a>\n    <div class=\"role\">(<i>Co-Instructor</i>)</div>\n</div>\n\n            </div>\n        \n        <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/gadown.js\"></script>\n    \n\n</body></html>"
