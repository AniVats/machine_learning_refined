Below you can find summaries of our current research efforts, links to recent papers, and summaries of past research efforts.Here are a some recent research topics that were actively pursued in our group.\nWhile Ultra-Wide-Band (UWB) Radar has existed for decades, it has been more actively investigated in recent years as both an alternative wireless communication technology, as well as a biometric sensor because of its excellent ranging resolution, low power, and sensitivity to human motion.  In collaboration with Prof. Hossein Hashimi at USC, we are investigating the use of UWB radar to detect and track human motion for safety and security applications.  \nWe are interested in developing methods to automatically identify and classify \"activities\" in data\nstreams, such as video sequences. A practical application and motivation for this work is automated\ntracking and recognition of biological organism behavior in controlled laboratory environments.  \n incorporates sensor information, reflecting the current state of the\nenvironment, into a robot\\'s planning process, as opposed to classical planning , where full\nknowledge of the world\\'s geometry is assumed to be known prior to the planning event. Current and\nrecent interests of our group include\n"]}
