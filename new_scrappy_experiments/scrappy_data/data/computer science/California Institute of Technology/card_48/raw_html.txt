Models of computation are developed that incorporate essential features of molecular folding, molecular self-assembly, biochemical circuits, and molecular robotics. These models are studied to determine their expressiveness for programming molecular-level tasks including decision-making, memory, behavior, and morphogenesis. \u00a0Methods for compiling abstract molecular programs into actual molecules are developed and tested in the laboratory.</p>\n<a href=\"http://www.dna.caltech.edu/~winfree\">Personal Page</a>\n</div>\n</div>"
