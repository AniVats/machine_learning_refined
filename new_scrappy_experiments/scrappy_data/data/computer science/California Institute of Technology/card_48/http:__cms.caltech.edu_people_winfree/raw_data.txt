Models of computation are developed that incorporate essential features of molecular folding, molecular self-assembly, biochemical circuits, and molecular robotics. These models are studied to determine their expressiveness for programming molecular-level tasks including decision-making, memory, behavior, and morphogenesis. \u00a0Methods for compiling abstract molecular programs into actual molecules are developed and tested in the laboratory.\n<h3>List of Research Areas</h3>\nmolecular programming, DNA nanotechnology, DNA computing, cell-free biochemical circuits, nucleic acid systems, biophysics, complexity theory, programming languages and compilers, evolutionary systems\n<!-- Related News link -->"]}
