Whereas the process of discovery is usually based on a combination of trial and error,\u00a0 insight and plain guesswork, his research is motivated by the facilitation/automation possibilities\u00a0 emerging from these interplays.\n<h3>List of Research Areas</h3>\nStatistical Numerical Approximation. Numerical homogenization. Operator adapted wavelets. Fast solvers. Gaussian process regression. Machine learning. Multi-scale and stochastic analysis. Stochastic mechanics and geometric integration.
