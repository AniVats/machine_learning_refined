Puckett Professor of Electrical Engineering\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Professor Perona's research focusses on vision: how do we see and how can we build machines that see.</p>\n<p>Professor Perona is currently interested visual recognition, more specifically visual categorization. He is studying how machines can learn to recognize frogs, cars, faces and trees with minimal human supervision, and how machines can learn from human experts. His project `Visipedia' has produced two smart device apps (iNaturalist and Merlin Bird ID) that anyone can use to recognize the species of plants and animals from a photograph.</p>\n<p>In collaboration with Professors Anderson and Dickinson, professor Perona is building vision systems and statistical techniques for measuring actions and activities in fruit flies and mice. This enables geneticists and neuroethologists to investigate the relationship between genes, brains and behavior.</p>\n<p>Professor Perona is also interested in studying how humans perform visual tasks, such as searching and recognizing image content. One of his recent projects studies how to harness the visual ability of thousands of people on the web.</p>\n<a href=\"http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Perona.html\">Personal Page</a>\n</div>\n</div>"
