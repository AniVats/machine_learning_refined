Puckett Professor of Electrical Engineering at Caltech. He directs Computation and Neural Systems (www.cns.caltech.edu), a PhD program centered on the study of biological brains and intelligent machines. Professor Perona's research centers on vision. He has contributed to the theory of partial differential equations for image processing and boundary formation, and to modeling the early visual system's function. He is currently interested in visual categories and visual recognition. Research interests"]}
