He is currently working on systems that sense and respond to: (a) seismic events, (b) threat events such as the introduction of nuclear radiation material, (c) medical events such a fetal distress, and (d) events in the power grid. The systems use sensor networks, cloud computing and event-driven architecture. The theory is based on optimization, control, machine learning and game theory.\n<h3>List of Research Areas</h3>\ndistributed systems, verification and validation of concurrent systems, software packages for analyzing streams of data.\n<!-- Related News link -->"]}
