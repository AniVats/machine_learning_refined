(Mani) Chandy</a></strong>\n<p>\n<strong>\nSimon Ramo Professor of Computer Science, Emeritus\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Professor Chandy builds and analyzes systems that sense and respond to changes. He is currently working on systems that sense and respond to: (a) seismic events, (b) threat events such as the introduction of nuclear radiation material, (c) medical events such a fetal distress, and (d) events in the power grid. The systems use sensor networks, cloud computing and event-driven architecture. The theory is based on optimization, control, machine learning and game theory.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.AssembleSoftware.com\">Personal Page</a>\n</div>\n</div>"
