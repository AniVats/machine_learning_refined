With postdoc Cody Geary\nand visitor Ebbe Andersen, I work on RNA origami architectures for\nfolding RNA into arbitrary shapes.  We share resources with the <a href=\"http://www.dna.caltech.edu/\"> laboratory\n</a> of professor <a href=\"http://www.dna.caltech.edu/~winfree\"> Erik\nWinfree\n</a> at <a href=\"http://www.caltech.edu/\">Caltech</a>. We collaborate\non many projects; papers are available on the <a href=\"http://www.dna.caltech.edu/DNApublications-Rothemund.html\">\npublications </a> page. My curriculum vitae is available <a href=\"http://www.dna.caltech.edu/~pwkr/vitae-current-complete.pdf\">\nhere. </a> \n</p><p>\nI have had the good fortune to be supported by the <a href=\"http://www.nsf.gov/\"> NSF </a>, the CISE directorate <a href=\"http://www.nsf.gov/dir/index.jsp?org=CISE\"> Computer &amp; Information\nScience and Engineering </a> has been particularly\ngenerous. Similarly, the <a href=\"http://www.src.org/\">\nSemiconductor Research Corporation </a>, through its <a href=\"http://www.fena.org/\"> FENA </a> program, has funded much of our\nrecent work attempting to marry DNA self-assembly with\nmicrofabrication. A grant from <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/\"> Microsoft Research </a> seeded\nour efforts to study stacking bonds between DNA origami. We have a\ngrant from the <a href=\"http://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?page=70\"> Army (ARO)\nBiochemistry program </a> to study the bacterial actin homolog parM\nwith <a href=\"http://mullinslab.ucsf.edu/\"> Dyche Mullins </a> from\nUCSF.  And we have a grant from DARPA, under its <a href=\"http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/MTO/Programs/Living_Foundries.aspx\">\nLiving Foundries </a> program, to create excitable biochemical wires\nanalogous to the long range signal carriers of the nervous system, the\naxons.\n\n<br> </p><hr> My interests lie at the interface of computer science,\nbiology, and chemistry.  By this I do not mean the application of\ncomputer science to solve problems in biology or chemistry such as the\nprotein folding problem. Rather, I am interested in how processes in\nbiology and chemistry can actually act as computers and execute\nmolecular algorithms. \n\nIn August 2008, a group of 6 Caltech and University of Washington PIs\nwere awarded a $10 million grant National Science Foundation Grant for\ndeveloping this idea: <a href=\"http://www.ist.caltech.edu/mpp/\"> The\nMolecular Programming Project </a>.  There are several video\npresentations linked from this site about Molecular Programming,\nincluding a <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/paul_rothemund_details_dna_folding.html\">\npublic talk </a> which I delivered at the TED conference.\n\n<br> <hr> In 2006, I reported a method of creating nanoscale shapes\nand patterns using DNA. Each of the two smiley faces above, at right,\nare actually giant DNA complexes imaged with an atomic force\nmicroscope. Each is about 100 nanometers across (1/1000th the width of\na human hair), 2 nanometers thick, and each is comprised of about\n14,000 DNA bases. 7000 of these DNA bases belong to a long single\nstrand, a DNA molecule that just happens to be the genome of the virus\nM13. The other 7000 of these bases belong to about 250 shorter\nstrands, each about 30 bases long. These short strands fold the long\nstrand into the smiley face shape. I call the method \"scaffolded DNA\norigami\". (For the record: there is no fundamental significance to the\nfact that it is viral DNA; I could buy it and it was cheap and\npure. M13 is a bacteriophage---it can make the bacteria in your\nintestine sick but not you! Also, I apologize to my Japanese\ncolleagues for the name \"DNA origami\" which literally translated would\nbe \"DNA paper folding\"---English speakers sometimes use \"origami\" as\nverb meaning just \"to fold up\", similar to the way we use \"pretzel\" as\na verb---thus \"DNA origami\" had the feeling of \"DNA folding\" even\nthough it is an abuse of the word \"origami\".)\n\n<br> \n<hr>\nWhile the smiley face shape is somewhat silly DNA artwork, it is\na high technology artifact and there is serious science behind it. We\nhope to use the technique of DNA origami (as well as many other\ntechniques of DNA nanotechnology) to build smaller, faster computers\nand many other devices. \n\n<br> \n<hr>\n\n\nThe best way to understand how this works is to read the \n<a href=\"http://www.dna.caltech.edu/Papers/DNAorigami-nature.pdf\">\noriginal article</a> published in <a href=\"http://www.nature.com\"> Nature </a>. \n<p>\n\nThere are two supplemental files associated with this paper.  The\nfirst <a href=\"DNAorigami-supp1.linux.pdf\"> (82 pages, 6.3 megabytes)\n</a> describes the design method, block diagrams for the designs,\nsequences for all of the designs, and includes data on control\nexperiments.  This file is likely to be of most interest.  The second\n<a href=\"DNAorigami-supp2.pdf\"> (9 pages, 192 kilobytes) </a> includes diagrams for all the\ndesigns that have the full sequence written out in the diagrams.  This\nfile is useful if one wishes to check details of the design or modify\nthem. It cannot be printed clearly and is best viewed with a PDF\nviewer on the screen.  Please email me with your PDF viewer name and\nversion if either of these files do not work for you.\n</p><p>\n\nI apologize that the MATLAB code for the design of origami structures\nhas not been released. Unfortunately the code was in such a bad state\nthat it proved too difficult to clean up for release. Luckily it was\nquickly obsolesced by much better software <a href=\"http://cadnano.org/\"> caDNAno </a>, by <a href=\"http://www.shawndouglas.com/me.html\"> Shawn Douglas </a> at Harvard.\nWe use caDNAno to design DNA origami almost every day. It features a\ngreat graphical user interface, and a large number of other scientists\nare developing software that interfaces with caDNAno. Thus it has\nreally become the standard for DNA origami design.  The <a href=\"http://cadnano.org/\"> latest version of caDNAno </a> is recommended,\nbut you may also be interested in a previous version, available from a\nrepository of <a href=\"http://cadnano.org/legacy\"> legacy caDNAno code\n</a>.\n</p><p>\n\nIf you are interested in DNA origami, and DNA nanotechnology in\ngeneral, and want more information, please email me. I maintain a list of \nresearchers in DNA origami, as well as lists and repositories of references which\nI am happy to share. </p><p>\n\n\n<br>\n</p><hr>\n\nOnce the basic design for a shape has been completed, one can add a\nsurface pattern on top of the shape. For demonstration purposes in the\nNature paper, the surface pattern was also made out of DNA although in\nprinciple it could be rendered using a chemically, electronically, or\noptically interesting material. Because each staple occurs in a\nunique location in the origami shape, this location can serve as a\npixel. The normal DNA staple can represent a '0' or a flat pixel.  A\nmodified DNA staple with an extra DNA bump (a DNA hairpin) can be used\nto represent a '1'. This is what has been done for the first three\nimages below, the map, some snowflakes, and the word 'DNA' rendered\nabove a representation of the double helix. Each of these patterns has\nbeen applied on a roughly 100 nanometer wide rectangle and each pixel\nis roughly 6 nanometers in size. Because there are about 200 staples,\neach pattern can have 200 pixels. Two copies of the origami have stuck\ntogether in the third image to make the helix appear\ncontinuous. Errors occasionally occur as in the lefthand 'D' in the\nfirst 'DNA' at right.\n<p>\n\n<img src=\"i/map_col11small.jpg\" border=\"2\" height=\"200\">\n<img src=\"i/snowflake_col5small.jpg\" border=\"2\" height=\"200\">\n<img src=\"i/dna005-2-crpsmall.jpg\" border=\"2\" height=\"200\">\n</p><p>\n\nThe structure below is a hexagon that is actually built up of six origami triangles. Each triangle\nhas a pattern added to it (the green bumps) so that orientation of the triangles in the hexagon can be ascertained. \n</p><p>\n<img src=\"i/hex-col11small.jpg\" border=\"2\" height=\"200\">\n</p><p>\nAll of the images shown here are actual atomic force microscope (AFM)\ndata of DNA molecules (smoothed to remove noise).  An AFM measures surface topography. Here,\nfalse color is used to indicate height. The height of a basic shape\n(say the smileys) is just the 2 nanometer thickness of DNA. Wherever a\nDNA bump has been added in a pattern the surface height is 4\nnanometers. The height contrast has been exaggerated (with respect to\nthe lateral dimensions) to emphasize the topography.\n\n<br>\n</p><hr>\nImportantly, there is a long list of people who do work on DNA\nnanotechnology.
