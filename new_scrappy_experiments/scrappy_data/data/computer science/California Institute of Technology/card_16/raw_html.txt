His work has focused primarily on methods for causal discovery from statistical data, the use of experiments in causal discovery, the integration of causal inferences from different data sets and the philosophical issues at the foundations of causality and probability. He has done some work on computational models in cognitive science and some historical work on the philosophy of Hans Reichenbach, especially his frequentist interpretation of probability.</p>\n<a href=\"http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~fde/index.html\">Personal Page</a>\n</div>\n</div>"
