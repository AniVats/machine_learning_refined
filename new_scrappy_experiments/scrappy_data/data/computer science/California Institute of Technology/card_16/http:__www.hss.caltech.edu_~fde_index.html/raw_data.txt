Before coming to Caltech I was Assistant Professor in the <a class=\"invisible\" href=\"http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/%7Epnp/\">\n\t\t       Philosophy-Neuroscience-Psychology (PNP) program</a>\n\t\t       and the <a class=\"invisible\" href=\"http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/%7Ephilos/\">\n\t\t       Department of Philosophy</a> at \n\t\t       <a class=\"invisible\" href=\"http://www.wustl.edu/\">Washington University\n\t\t       in St. Louis</a>. In 2011 I took a two year research leave to work on causal discovery methods at <a class=\"invisible\" href=\"http://www.cmu.edu/\">Carnegie Mellon University</a> with a grant from the <a class=\"invisible\" href=\"http://www.jsmf.org/\">James S. McDonnell Foundation</a>. Before going to St. Louis I\n\t\t       was a McDonnell postdoc at the <a class=\"invisible\" href=\"http://icbs.berkeley.edu/\">\n\t\t       Institute of Cognitive and Brain Sciences</a>\n\t\t       at the <a class=\"invisible\" href=\"http://berkeley.edu/\">University of\n\t\t       California, Berkeley</a>. I completed my Ph.D.\n\t\t       in the <a class=\"invisible\" href=\"http://www.hss.cmu.edu/philosophy/\">Philosophy\n\t\t       Department</a> at <a class=\"invisible\" href=\"http://www.cmu.edu/\">Carnegie Mellon University</a>.\n\t\t\t \n\t\t      \n<h5><b>research</b></h5>\n\n\t\t\t My research interests lie at the formal end of philosophy of science, the machine learning end of statistics and computer science, and the learning and modeling end of psychology and cognitive science. My work has focused primarily on methods for causal discovery from statistical data, the use of experiments in causal discovery, the integration of causal inferences from different data sets and the philosophical issues at the foundations of causality and probability. I have done some work on computational models in cognitive science and some historical work on the philosophy of Hans Reichenbach, especially his frequentist interpretation of probability."]}
