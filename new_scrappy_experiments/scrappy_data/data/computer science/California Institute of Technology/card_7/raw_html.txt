He works in the Bayesian formulation of inverse problems, and in data assimilation for dynamical systems. Quantification of uncertainty plays a significant role in this work. Current applications of interest include a variety of problems in the geophysical sciences, and in graph-based learning.</p>\n<a href=\"http://stuart.caltech.edu/\">Research Group</a>\n</div>\n</div>"
