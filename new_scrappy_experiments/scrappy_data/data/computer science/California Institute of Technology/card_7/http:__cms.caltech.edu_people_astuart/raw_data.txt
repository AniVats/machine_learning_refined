He works in the Bayesian formulation of inverse problems, and in data assimilation for dynamical systems. Quantification of uncertainty plays a significant role in this work. Current applications of interest include a variety of problems in the geophysical sciences, and in graph-based learning.\n<h3>List of Research Areas</h3>\nData Assimilation, Inverse Problems, Stochastic Modeling\n<!-- Related News link -->"]}
