Housner Professor of Engineering and Applied Science, Emeritus, at\nthe California Institute of Technology in 2017. Although I no longer run a research group, I am\ncollaborating with other researchers at different institutions. I have also been pursuing research\ninterests on my own, especially on the foundations of quantum mechanics.\nMy research is focused primarily on stochastic dynamics where I use Bayesian probability as a\nlogic to handle the uncertainties involved in the modeling of physical systems and their\nexcitation. I have a particular interest in the dynamics of structural systems, including stochastic\nresponse prediction under earthquakes, and using sensor data from monitoring structures for\nsystem identification and structural health monitoring. I have published on many research\ntopics, including robust-to-modeling-uncertainty response prediction and performance\nreliability, structural health monitoring, seismic loss estimation, performance-based\nearthquake-resistant design, seismic early warning, stochastic robust structural control,\nBayesian updating and model class selection using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation\nmethods, Bayesian state and parameter estimation using particle filter methods, and sparse\nBayesian learning."]}
