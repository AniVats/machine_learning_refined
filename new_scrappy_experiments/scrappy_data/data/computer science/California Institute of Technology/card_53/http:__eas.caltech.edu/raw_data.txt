This could allow for more widespread and easier monitoring of stress, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression. \"We aim to develop a wearable system that can collect multimodal data, including both vital sign and molecular biomarker information, to obtain the accurate classification for deep space stress and anxiety,\" Gao says.
