Her current efforts explore one of the most exciting avenues in today's information theory: the nonasymptotic regime. Leveraging tools from the theory of random processes and concentration of measure, she pursues fundamental insight into modern delay-constrained communication systems.\n<h3>List of Research Areas</h3>\ninformation theory, coding theory, communications, control.\u00a0\n<!-- Related News link -->"]}
