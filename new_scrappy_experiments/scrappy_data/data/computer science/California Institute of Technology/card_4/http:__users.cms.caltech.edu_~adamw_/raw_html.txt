Though diverse, the areas are all essential to my broader research goal: easing the incorporation of renewable energy into IT and, more generally, into the electricity grid. Broadly, my particular research style can be described as: <b> \"Rigorous system design.\"</b>  I use mathematical models to provide insight into the design of computer systems, markets, and power systems.  This means that beyond our work on applications, my group also develops new analytic tools and analytic techniques, specifically in the areas of online algorithms, optimization, machine learning, market design, and control.  Some areas where are groups has focused in the past few years include:<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <ul class=\"projects\">\n\n    <li>\n     <p class=\"question\"> Platforms and Networked markets</p>\n        These days it is almost impossible to study communication networks without considering economic incentives.  From net neutrality to the sharing economy, understanding the economic incentives in networks has become crucial.  However, our understanding the interaction of economics and networks is still in its infancy.

You can also take a look at <a href=\"publications-1#Network Economics\"> my papers in this area</a> and a couple of recent talks on the topic regarding <a href=\"http://helper.ipam.ucla.edu/wowzavideo.aspx?vfn=12619.mp4&amp;vfd=GSS2015\">networked Cournot competition</a> <a href=\"http://helper.ipam.ucla.edu/wowzavideo.aspx?vfn=12867.mp4&amp;vfd=GSS2015\">(part II is here)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.birs.ca/events/2013/5-day-workshops/13w5136/videos/watch/201302281615-Wierman.mp4\">cloud computing markets</a>.\n       </li>\n\n    <li>\n     <p class=\"question\"> Markets for the Smart Grid</p>\n       Over the coming decade, the electricity network will undergo a complete architectural transformation, similar to what has happened to the communication network over the last decades. However, there are huge engineering and economic challenges in making this transformation possible.   In fact, unlike in the case of communication networks, the economic market structure and engineering architecture are inherently intertwined in the electricity grid, which necessitates a new architectural theory for guiding this transformation.

The electricity usage of data centers is growing 12 times faster than that of the US as a whole!  While the last decade has led to significant improvements in energy-efficiency across IT, there is still a long ways to go to be truly sustainable.  You can find out more at the <a href=\"http://rsrg.cms.caltech.edu/greenIT/\">RSRG Sustainable IT group page</a> and the <a href=\"http://resnick.caltech.edu/\">Resnick Institute website</a>.

This is especially true within computer systems, where heavy-tails seemingly pop up everywhere -- from degree distributions in the internet and social networks to file sizes and interarrival times of workloads. However, despite nearly a decade of work on heavy-tails they are still treated as mysterious, surprising, and even controversial.\n      We are in the process of writing <a href=\"heavytails.html\">a new book on the topic</a> that will (hopefully) highlight that heavy-tailed distributions need not be mysterious and should not be surprising or controversial.  <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/7sW9Iie5h1nUImGo1\">You can download pre-publication versions of completed chapters here.</a> For details about our research on this topic you can check out <a href=\"publications-1#Large Deviations\"> my papers in this area</a> and <a href=\"papers/2013-SIGMETRICS-heavytails.pdf\">slides from a tutorial</a> on the topic.\n\n     </li><li>\n     <p class=\"question\"> \"Empirical\" Algorithmic game theory </p>\n        One of the fundamental tasks for research at the intersection of CS and Economics is to understand how to incorporate \"computation\" into classic economic theories.  Toward this end, over the last decade, the task of understanding the computational complexity of economics models has been a cornerstone of the field and an understanding has emerged that many standard economic models are \"hard\" in the worst case.  Motivated by this, our work looks at the question of whether these \"hard\" examples appear in real-world economic settings.  More specifically, we look at whether data can reveal hard instances of economic models and we seek to quantify what properties of data sets necessitate hardness in inferred economic models. For details you can see <a href=\"publications-1#Algorithmic Game Theory\"> our papers in this area</a> or the <a href=\"talks/2014-revealedpref-UIUC.pdf\">slides from a  talk I gave on the topic.</a>\n    </li>\n\n<!--    <li>\n      <p class=\"question\"> Social networks </p>\n      Our understanding of the structure of social networks (and other complex networks) has grown dramatically over the last decade and from this understanding has emerged nearly `universal' properties such as small world properties, heavy-tailed degree distributions, etc.  Our research looks at how these properties can be exploited to solve problems that, without such structure, would be intractable.\n  <a href=\"publications-1#Social Networks\"> Our work in this area...\n       </a>\n      </li> -->\n\n<!--\n    <li>\n      <p class=\"question\">  Non-cooperative, cooperative control</p>\n        Distributed cooperative control problems are everywhere, and are especially important in wireless and sensor network applications; however designing robust distributed control protocols is especially challenging.  We are studying an inherently robust approach to distributed control that is based on formulating the distributed agents as selfish players in a non-cooperative, engineered game.   <a href=\"publications-1#Control Theory\"> Our work in this area...</a>\n      </li>\n-->\n\n<!--\n    <li>\n      <p class=\"question\"> Queueing games</p>\n       Queueing theory has a long and storied history, but throughout this history, nearly all work has assumed that the workload is a fixed and non-interactive.  In reality, as performance changes users will react and so the workload will also change.  Modeling such interactions requires a mixture of queueing theory (to model the system) and game theory (to model the users).  Once the strategic users are considered, new perspectives on classic results emerge.  <a href=\"publications-1#Queueing Games\"> Our work in this area...</a>\n      </li>\n-->\n\n\n    <li>\n    <p class=\"question\">  Fairness and scheduling</p>\n      Modern designs often improve user response times by giving priority to small job sizes.  But, this leads to worries about whether large job sizes receive fair performance.\n      So, we need to ask: How much starvation/unfairness is caused to large jobs by prioritizing small jobs?
