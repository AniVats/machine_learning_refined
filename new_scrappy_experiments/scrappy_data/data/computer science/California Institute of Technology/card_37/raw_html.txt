These range from geometric modeling (effective methods to model the shape of objects) to animation (simulation of physical phenomena such as the deformation of cloth). His emphasis is on an area known as \"Discrete Differential Geometry.\" Its goals are to rebuild the foundations of classical differential geometry in a discrete setting which makes it immediately useful for computation.</p>\n</div>\n</div>"
