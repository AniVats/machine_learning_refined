Particular interests include shock driven flow instabilities, turbulence, simulation approaches for high strain rate solid mechanics. He is also interested on development of adaptive numeriocal methods for such flows that are suitable for high performance computation.</p>\n<a href=\"http://www.galcit.caltech.edu\">Research Group</a>\n</div>\n</div>"
