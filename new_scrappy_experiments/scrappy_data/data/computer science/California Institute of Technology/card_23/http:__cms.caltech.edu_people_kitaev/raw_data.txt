His main contribution was the concept of topological quantum computation, a scheme where quantum information is protected from errors due to special properties of the underlying physical system, which are generally related to topology. He currently focuses on topological classification of quantum phases (a nontrivial example being the 2-dimensional electron liquid in the quantum Hall regime).\n<h3>List of Research Areas</h3>\nquantum computation, topological quantum phases, anyons, topological insulators and superconductors\n<!-- Related News link -->"]}
