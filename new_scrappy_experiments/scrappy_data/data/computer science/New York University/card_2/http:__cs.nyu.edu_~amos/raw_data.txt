His most rewarding professional validation to date was standing on a crowded NYC subway surreptitiously looking down at a seated passenger reading a Metro newspaper article about himself and his work. That happened only once, though Amos has been responsible for the research, strategy, design, and implementation of dozens of popular apps, websites, and marketing campaigns on behalf of a wide range of clients, from the UN to Facebook and Microsoft, from Amex to Juicy Couture, from MTV to Amazon, and on to small non-profits and tech startups whose names are rightly forgotten to history. His own award-winning non-commercial creative work has been featured in Forbes, the New York Times, the Village Voice, and Wired, etc, etc. \nPrincipal of a high-end interactive design consultancy advising clients in research, business analysis, user research, experience design, service design, and the goal-oriented engineering of apps and ecosystems. Building relationships with a wide range of clients, from direct work with Fortune 500\u2019s, to vendor work for larger tech firms and ad agencies, and bootstrapping with small start-ups and cultural institutions.\n"]}
