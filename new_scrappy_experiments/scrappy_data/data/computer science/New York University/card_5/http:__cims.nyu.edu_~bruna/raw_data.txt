In particular, in the past few years I have been working on Deep Learning, studying some of its theoretical properties. I am interested in generalisations of CNNs to more general geometries and their applications to Physics, Chemistry and Computational Complexity. I also recently started to study the theoretical aspects of Reinforcement Learning and its geometrical properties."]}
