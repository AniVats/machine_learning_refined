If you are interested in joining my research group please read  My research aims at using vast amounts of robotic data in conjunction with machine learning to produce useful, complex, and general behavior in robots. This has lead me in three directions: (a) How can we obtain large and diverse robotic data?, (b) How do you learn generalizable skills with this data?, and (c) How can we effectively use simulations to accelerate real-world learning?  \n                                                and mention my name (as well as others that interest you) in your research statement.
