On occasion, I\n      can host visiting Ph.D. students. Undergraduates: I have both\n      implementation and more theoretical projects; you need to have\n      taken Basic Algorithms. Note that I am rarely able to take on\n      summer students from outside NYU. High school students: please\n      send me email explaining your interests and skills; some\n      programming experience is a huge plus. So that I can avoid\n      broadcast emails please end you subject line the first time you\n      write to me with the number 42. "]}
