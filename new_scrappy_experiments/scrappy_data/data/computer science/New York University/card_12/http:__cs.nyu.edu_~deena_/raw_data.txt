She teaches undergraduate computer science courses on web and database technologies, as well as courses for undergraduate and graduate students in the Digital Humanities and the Arts. She also supervises undergraduate and graduate student research projects in the Digital Humanities and the Arts and collaborates on research on the conservation of software-based art and on digital studies in literature and the visual arts. Prior to entering academe, she ran a systems group in an international art auction house for nine years. Students worked on a research project preparing documentation on a work of computational art in order to facilitate conservation decisions about this work in particular and to provide a model for this process for such works\n                    in general. The documentation included an overview of the technologies\n                    used, a flowchart of the work, identification and narrative descriptions\n                    of the functions and procedures and an overview to contextualize the work\n                    within the field of current computational art.
