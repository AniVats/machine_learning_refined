My work has focused primarily on spatial and physical reasoning,\nbut I have also looked at reasoning about knowledge, belief, plans, and goals,\nand their interaction with physical reasoning. \n\n<h4> <a href=\"research.html\">Current research projects</a> </h4>\n<ul>\n <a href=\"research.html#Containers\"> \nReasoning about Containers </a>\n <a href=\"research.html#Matter\"> \nOntology of Matter and other Physical Reasoning</a>\n <a href=\"research.html#QSR\"> \nQualitative Spatial Reasoning </a>\n <a href=\"research.html#Text\"> \nCommonsense Reasoning and Text Comprehension</a> <br/>\n <a href=\"research.html#Probability\"> \nCommonsense Reasoning and Probability Theory</a>\n</ul>\n\nIf you are interested in commonsense reasoning, you should check out the\nrecent symposium  \n<a href=\"http://commonsensereasoning.org\"> Commonsense 2017. </a>\nYou might also like to look at the\n<a href=\"http://www-formal.Stanford.EDU/leora/commonsense\">\nCommon Sense Problem Page, </a> the\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.nyu.edu/faculty/davise/papers/WinogradSchemas/WS.html\">\nWinograd Schema Challenge, </a> and the \n<a href=\"http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/9/191169-commonsense-reasoning-and-commonsense-knowledge-in-artificial-intelligence/fulltext\">\nCACM 2015 article surveying the state of the art </a>\nby Gary Marcus and me. \n\n\n\n<pre>\n</pre>\n<name id=\"Pubs\">"]}
