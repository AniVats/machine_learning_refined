Neill is Associate Professor of Computer Science \nand Public Service at NYU\u2019s Courant Institute Department of Computer Science\nand Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, and \nAssociate Professor of Urban Analytics at NYU\u2019s Center for Urban Science \nand Progress, where he directs the Machine Learning for Good (ML4G) \nLaboratory and co-directs the NYU Urban Initiative.  He was previously a tenured faculty member at Carnegie \nMellon University\u2019s Heinz College, where he was the Dean\u2019s Career \nDevelopment Professor, Associate Professor of Information Systems, and \nDirector of the Event and Pattern Detection Laboratory.  He received his \nM.Phil. from Cambridge University and his M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer \nScience from Carnegie Mellon University.  Dr. Neill\u2019s research focuses on \ndeveloping new methods for machine learning and event detection in massive \nand complex datasets, with applications ranging from medicine and public \nhealth to law enforcement and urban analytics.  He works closely with \norganizations including public health, police departments, hospitals, and \ncity leaders to create and deploy data-driven tools and systems to improve \nthe quality of public health, safety, and security, for example, through \nthe early detection of disease outbreaks and through predicting and \npreventing hot-spots of violent crime.  He is also the Associate Editor of \nfour journals (IEEE Intelligent Systems, Decision Sciences, Security \nInformatics, and ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems). He \nwas the recipient of an NSF CAREER award and an NSF Graduate Research \nFellowship, and was named one of the \"top ten artificial intelligence \nresearchers to watch\" by IEEE Intelligent Systems.<br><br><hr> \n<h3>Research:</h3> My research is focused on novel statistical and \ncomputational methods for discovery of emerging events and other relevant \npatterns in complex and massive datasets, applied to real-world policy \nproblems ranging from medicine and public health to law enforcement and \nsecurity.  Application areas include <b>disease surveillance</b> (e.g., \nusing electronically available public health data such as hospital visits \nand medication sales to automatically identify and characterize emerging \noutbreaks), <b>law enforcement</b> (e.g., detection and prediction of \ncrime patterns using offense reports and 911 calls), <b>health care</b> \n(e.g., detecting anomalous patterns of care which significantly impact \npatient outcomes), and <b>urban analytics</b> (e.g., helping city \ngovernments to predict and proactively respond to emerging patterns of \ncitizen needs).<br><br>\n\n<a href=\"selected_pubs_by_topic.html\">Selected publications by \ntopic</a><br>\n<a href=\"pubs_by_year.html\">Publications (chronological)</a><br>\n<a href=\"pres_by_year.html\">Presentations (chronological)</a><br>\n<a href=\"papers/cv.pdf\">My CV</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=R14UJTMAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">My \nGoogle Scholar page</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~neill\">CMU homepage (old)</a><br><br>\nWhich projects am I most excited about these days?  So glad you \nasked!  In no particular order:\n\t\n<ul>\n<li> <b>Pre-syndromic surveillance</b> is a new way of thinking about \npublic health and disease surveillance, using unstructured data to detect novel \nbio-threats and other emerging patterns of interest to public health.\n</li><li> <b>Algorithmic fairness</b>, particularly, how we can audit black-box \nalgorithms to identify and correct systematic biases in risk prediction.\n</li><li> Discovering <b>heterogeneous treatment effects</b> in both randomized \nexperiments and observational data, e.g., identifying patterns of care \nthat impact patient health outcomes, and analyzing the impacts of exposure \nto poor housing conditions on health.\n</li><li> Detecting patterns in <b>massive, complex data</b> such as images, \ntext, and social media, with applications including civil unrest prediction, rare disease \noutbreak detection, and discovery of emerging patterns of human rights \nabuses.\n</li><li> Automating the detection of <b>natural experiments</b>, including \nregression discontinuities, difference-in-differences, and instrumental variables, \nfor causal inference.\n</li><li> Modeling and detecting patterns in <b>complex urban data</b>, \nintegrating \ntwo of my favorite methodological approaches.  <b>Scalable Gaussian \nprocesses</b> enable accurate modeling and prediction in correlated \nspatio-temporal data.  Then, given this model of \"typical\" system \nbehavior, <b>subset scanning</b> can reliably detect subtle deviations by \nidentifying subsets of the data that are collectively anomalous.\n</li><li> <b>Predictive policing</b>, including a randomized field trial to \nanalyze the impact of targeted hot-spot patrolling on violent crime, and \nother applications of machine learning for law enforcement and criminal justice.\n</li><li> <b>Opioid abuse and overdose surveillance</b>, using data from \nprescription drug monitoring programs, law enforcement, and county medical \nexaminers.\n</li><li> Continuing to extend our <b>fast subset scan</b> methodology for \npattern detection, e.g., to massive graphs, multidimensional data, and \nirregularly-shaped spatial clusters.\n</li></ul>\n\nA detailed statement of my research interests (last updated October 2017) can be found <a href=\"papers/research.pdf\">here</a>.<br><br><hr>\n\n<h3>Latest News:</h3>\n\nThe Machine Learning for Good Laboratory's <a href=\"http://wp.nyu.edu/ml4good\">web page</a> is now live!

Please \nconsider submitting your ML/AI for Good work to this great \nconference!<br><br>\n\nOur project on \"Bias and Discrimination in City Predictive Analytics\" \n(NSF IIS-1926470, Kontokosta and Neill, PIs) was awarded funding from the \nNational Science Foundation.  Our goals are to improve urban analytics \nbased on 311 citizen complaints by developing new methods to identify \nsystematic biases in the propensity to complain, to understand the impact \nof reporting bias on predictive models for allocation of city services, \nand to enable city agencies to account for and correct these \nbiases.<br><br>\n\nI am serving as co-director of NYU's <a href=\"https://www.nyu.edu/academics/scholarly-strengths/urban-initiative.html\">Urban \nInitiative</a> for the 2019-2020 academic year.<br><br>\n\nI am serving as an area chair for the NeurIPS 2019 Workshop on AI for Social Good.
