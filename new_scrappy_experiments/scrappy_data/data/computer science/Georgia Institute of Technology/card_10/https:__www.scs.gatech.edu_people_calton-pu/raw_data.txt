In distributed systems, his focus is on extended transaction processing, system survivability, and Internet applications. In operating systems, he is applying the idea of specialization . Comparing with usual centralized systems, distributed and parallel systems softwares display unique characteristics in distance, complexity, extensibility, concurrency and availability. Making software handle these problems in a reliable and efficient way is the emphasis of Calton Pu's work. In the Infosphere project, he is developing concepts and software for Internet-scale applications driven by information flow such as real-time decision support, digital libraries, and electronic commerce."]}
