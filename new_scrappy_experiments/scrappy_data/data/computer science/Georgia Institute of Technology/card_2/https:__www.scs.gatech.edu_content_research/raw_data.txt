From groundbreaking detection and mitigation techniques in cyber security, to the latest trends in software-defined networking or advances in parallel programming and high performance systems, to a \u201creboot\u201d of traditional architecture in search of ever more efficient hardware, we are engaged every day in work that will support the tremendous demands placed on today\u2019s computing systems. We invite you to explore the subfields, centers, labs, and research groups that comprise our School\u2019s range of intellectual exploration.School of Computer Science research areas span the very foundations of computing itself, from software development and databases to networks and cybersecurity, and more.Serving to marshal the GT Computing forces of inquiry are its major research centers. Though based in the College of Computing, each center reaches across Georgia Tech in its membership."]}
