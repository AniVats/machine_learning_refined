Georgia Tech offers a rich and comprehensive curriculum, with courses in foundational and applied aspects of cryptography, networks, systems and software security, and policies and strategies for information security. A hands-on teaching laboratory allows students to assess security of realistic systems and experiment with techniques that can be used to protect them against specific types of threats."]}
