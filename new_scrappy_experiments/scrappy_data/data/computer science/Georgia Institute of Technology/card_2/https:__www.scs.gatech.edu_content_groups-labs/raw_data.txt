Most of the research projects conducted in DiSL have strong emphasis on systems issues such as scalability, reliability, security, availability and efficiency, and data management issues such as data storage, data mining and data analysis. We are interested in theories and techniques that not only make the distributed systems scalable and efficient but also reliable and secure.The Korvo research group of researchers focuses on pushing the boundaries of computer systems research. We take an experimental approach to computer systems, working heavily with industry and governmental stakeholders with real-world problems as motivation for our efforts to refine and fundamentally restructure the way operating systems work. Our interests cover the areas of Cloud Computing, High Performance Computing, and Internet of Things, with particular focus on building systems that can deal with tight orchestration of large streams of data, wherever that data source may come from.The Program Analysis Group in the School of Computer Science conducts research in the areas of programming languages and software engineering. We investigate algorithms and systems for improving programmer productivity and software quality, encompassing reliability, security, performance, scalability, and energy efficiency. Our current projects address these issues in the context of modern computing platforms, including parallel, mobile, and cloud computing.In the \u201cSS Lab,\u201d housed within the Georgia Tech Information Security Center, we build practical systems with focuses on security, performance, robustness, or often just for fun. Our research projects have been published in top academic conferences, and have made great impacts on real programs, such as Firefox and Android, that people use every day."]}
