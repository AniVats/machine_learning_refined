The School of Computer Science networks group seeks to understand the behavior and properties of networks and to use that understanding to solve real-world problems. We contribute tools, techniques, and insights that affect researchers, practitioners, and policy makers. For example, our work on the evolution and economics of Internet peering has contributed to the FCC debate on network neutrality; our tools for modeling Internet topology remain in use nearly 20 years after their development; and our techniques for high-speed network monitoring have been picked up by commercial router companies, such as Huawei.We welcome the involvement of curious and motivated students in our research projects and intellectual community. We have a long history of including undergraduates and M.S. students in research projects\u00a0alongside Ph.D. student colleagues, as well as a track record of placing students in exciting industry and academic positions."]}
