This forward-thinking decision has resulted in a Top 10 College of Computing that boasts the kind of breadth and depth few universities can match. It also means the School of Computer Science operates within an intellectual ecosystem that allows our faculty and students to push the envelope of computing research and enables them to identify collaborators at nearly any point of the computing spectrum."]}
