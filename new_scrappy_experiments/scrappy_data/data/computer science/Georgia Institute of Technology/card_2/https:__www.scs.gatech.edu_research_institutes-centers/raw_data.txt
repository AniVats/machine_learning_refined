How can we\u00a0 rethink\u2014even \u201creboot\u201d\u2014computing technology to restart the historic exponential performance growth we\u2019ve experienced over the past five decades? This is the premise underlying the Center for Research into Novel Computing Hierarchies (CRNCH), an interdisciplinary research center at Georgia Tech.The Institute for Data Engineering and Science (IDEaS) provides a unified point to connect government, industry, and academia to advance foundational research, and accelerate the adoption of Big Data technology. IDEaS leverages expertise and resources from throughout Georgia Tech's colleges, research labs, and external partners, to define and pursue grand challenges in data science foundations and in data-driven discovery. We are also dedicated to educating students and those already in the workforce through innovative educational and training programs.The Institute for Information Security & Privacy (IISP) at Georgia Tech is as an international leader in researching, developing, and disseminating technical solutions and policy about cybersecurity and privacy. We assemble strong, innovative, multi-disciplinary teams to address contemporary and future cybersecurity or privacy challenges faced by government, industry and individuals. Our graduates will become leaders in the government, scientific, industry and entrepreneurial communities."]}
