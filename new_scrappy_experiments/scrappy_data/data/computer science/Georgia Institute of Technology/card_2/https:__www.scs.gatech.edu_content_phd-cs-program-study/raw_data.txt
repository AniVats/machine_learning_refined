While one goal of this is for the student to gain practical experience in doing research, these semester-long projects also serve as a way for students and faculty to begin to explore potential advisor relationships.\nBefore students have a formal advisor, they are expected to register for CS 8903, Special Problems in Computer Science, under the supervision of a faculty member in the College. Registration for this course is restricted, and requires that students and the supervising faculty member <a href=\"http://www.cc.gatech.edu/current/doctoral/forms\">complete a form</a> describing the research to be completed over the course of the semester.\u00a0 Students may occasionally participate in multiple 8903 research projects in any given semester, given time and other commitments, and may participate in 8903 research projects for several semesters until they have a formal research advisor.\nOnce students have a formal advisor, they are expected to focus on what will become their dissertation research under the supervision of their advisor. At this stage, students will register for CS 8999, Doctoral Thesis Preparation.\u00a0 Students and their advisor must fill out the <a href=\"http://www.cc.gatech.edu/current/doctoral/forms\">CS 8999 permit form</a> that indicates the general research direction and that confirms the establishment of the advisory relationship. This form only needs to be filled out one time."]}
