Our Programming Languages & Software Engineering (PL & SE) group works on both performance optimizations and correctness problems for such systems, with research that focuses on a wide range of issues, from providing new abstractions for expressing parallelism, security, and real-time properties, to devising new program analysis and compiler optimization techniques, to examining managed runtimes and dynamic optimizations, to defining new techniques for testing and debugging modern software systems.The PL & SE group actively researches new techniques and tools that help programmers find critical but subtle software bugs and vulnerabilities by using powerful foundations in automatic theorem proving and automata theory and by leveraging new testing and debugging approaches. For example, we are developing techniques that find and eliminates (1) reliability bugs in concurrent programs, (2) performance bugs in heavily-used application libraries, (3) security bugs and attacks in critical circuit designs, and (4) subtle bugs in software after it has been deployed."]}
