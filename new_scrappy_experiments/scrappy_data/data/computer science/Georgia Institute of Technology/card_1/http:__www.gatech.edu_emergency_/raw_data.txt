The Georgia Tech Police Department (GTPD) Office of Emergency Preparedness is focused on helping the Institute reduce the effects of disasters through preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation activities. This office is responsible for implementing Georgia Tech\u2019s Emergency Action Plan and for working with building managers to create comprehensive emergency plans for their particular locations. To assure that ongoing concerns are addressed, Georgia Tech has an active Emergency Preparedness Advisory Group that meets quarterly and includes representatives from key Institute departments as well as the Atlanta Police Department (APD), Atlanta Fire Department (AFD), and the Atlanta/Fulton County Emergency Management Agency (AFCEMA)."]}
