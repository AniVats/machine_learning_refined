Prior to joining Stony Brook University, he was an assistant professor at Emory University. He was a research scientist at Siemens Corporate Research (Princeton, NJ) before joining Emory University.Dr. Wang's research covers data management and biomedical informatics, and in particular, the intersection of the two fields. His research goal on data management is to address the research challenges for delivering effective, scalable and expressive software systems for managing and querying complex data at multiple dimensions, including 2D and 3D spatial and imaging data, temporal data, spatial-temporal data, and sequencing data. The research goal on biomedical informatics is to develop novel methods and software systems to optimize the extraction, management, and mining of biomedical data with much improved efficiency, accuracy and interoperability to support biomedical research and the healthcare enterprise."]}
