Prior to joining Stony Brook, Shuai was a post-doctoral researcher and lecturer in New York University.\u00a0Shuai's research focuses on distributed systems, particularly on concurrency issues in large-scale storage systems. His work aims to improve the concurrency in distributed storage systems without sacrificing any correctness guarantees such as serializability and external consistency. His study leads to better designs in distributed/multicore database systems, hardware/software transactional memory systems, wide-area replication systems."]}
