Before he started his PhD studies, he was a software engineer at the Center For Natural Language Processing (CNLP) at Syracuse University. He completed his Masters degree in Computer Science at the University of Buffalo in 2003. Prior to joining the computer science department at Stony Brook in spring 2015, Dr. Balasubramanian was a post-doctoral researcher in the Turing Center at the University of Washington in Seattle.\u00a0Balasubramanian's research is\u00a0motivated by the challenge of building systems that can extract, understand, and reason with information present in natural language texts. His research interests are in two broad areas:\u00a0NLP\u00a0and\u00a0information retrieval. He has worked on different projects in areas like\u00a0\u00a0Question Answering at a 4th Grade Level,\u00a0Event Schema Generation from news stories, Machine Learning for Information Retrieval, Energy-efficient Mobile Search, and Automatic Wikipedia Pages."]}
