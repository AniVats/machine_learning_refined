He has developed innovative pathology informatics methods, including: the first published whole slide virtual microscope system; pioneering pathology computer-aided diagnosis techniques; and methods for decomposing pathology images into features and linking those features to cancer \u201comics\u201d, response to treatment and outcome. He has broken new ground in big data through development of the filter-stream based DataCutter system, the map-reduce style Active Data Repository and the inspector-executor runtime compiler framework. He has also been an active contributor in clinical informatics, having developed predictive models for hospital readmissions, point of care laboratory testing quality assurance systems, decision support systems for electrophoresis interpretation and graphical user interfaces to support clinical data warehouse queries. Dr. Saltz has been a pioneer in establishing the field of biomedical informatics; he founded and built two highly successful departments of biomedical informatics, one at Ohio State University and one at Emory University. In 2013, he came to Stony Brook as Vice President for Clinical Informatics and Founding Department Chair of Biomedical Informatics \u2013 to create a living laboratory for biomedical informatics and to create a third unique biomedical informatics department dually housed in the School of Medicine and the College of Engineering. Dr. Saltz is trained both as a computer scientist and as a physician through the MSTP program at Duke University. He has deep experience in computer science, having served on the computer science faculties at Yale University and the University of Maryland. He completed his residency in clinical pathology at Johns Hopkins University and he is a practicing, board-certified clinical pathologist.His research in Pathology spans twenty years and consists of closely coordinated efforts in image analysis, machine learning, database design and high end computing. He has developed tools and methods\u00a0 through years of funded projects supported by a wide range of institutes and agencies including NCI, NLM, NIBIB, NSF, DARPA, AFOSR, NASA, DOD and DOE. His seminal work in digital imaging laid the foundation for digital pathology as it is today.\u00a0 He was the first to develop the \u201cVirtual Microscope,\u201d and pioneered developments in digital pathology whole slide image navigation, data management and computer aided classification.Dr. Saltz\u2019s initial efforts included development of the first whole slide image viewer, and devising efficient methods for management, caching and supporting analytics carried out on whole slide datasets. This work became the foundation of the new field of Pathology Imaging Informatics, today investigators he mentored can be found carrying out exciting research in \u00a0institutions across the country.Over the years, Dr. Saltz has developed a rich set of Pathology informatics tools, methods and algorithms. For instance, he and his group have \u00a0recently developed a rich set of pipelines to compute a variety of biologically significant Pathology features, including spatial maps of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). The quantification of TILs is well documented to have prognostic value in many contexts; understanding patient immune response to tumors is increasingly important with the advance of cancer immunotherapy. For most cancer types, Pathologists do not comment on TILs in their reports and even in cancer types where TIL comments are sometimes made, they only use high level terms such as \u201cbrisk\u201d or \u201csparse\u201d. Dr. Saltz is able to\u00a0 precisely quantify percent\u00a0 tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and is also able to generate detailed TIL Maps.\u00a0 He has used these methods to generate publicly available whole slide TIL maps and spatial statistics for 13 cancer types and 5,000 subjects \u2013 these are available on The Cancer Imaging Archive.\u00a0 He is now extending and leveraging these methods in many other studies, as well as for the NCI SEER program.Joel Saltz,\u00a0 Dimitris Samaras,\u00a0 Tahsin Kurc, Chao Chen and Fusheng Wang form the Digital Pathology group at Stony Brook.\u00a0 This closely integrated research group targets development of AI and machine learning algorithms, numerical methods, software tools and database architectures for digital Pathology and multi-scale tissue analysis.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cooper, L.
