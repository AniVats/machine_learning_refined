In particular, his research aims to leverage mathematical tools such as {Performance Modeling,Queueing Theory,Control Theory} to analyze the behavior of systems such as {Distributed Systems,Cloud,Data Centers} and to optimize metrics of interest such as {Performance,Power,Energy}.Current research projects include building performance models for analytics workloads (for ex: MapReduce), applying queueing theory and control theory to provide performance guarantees for cloud-deployed applications (via scale-out and scale-up in OpenStack), scaling multi-tier applications in response to unpredictable workload demand, dynamically provisioning the caching tier, analysis of multi-server systems with setup costs (provisioning/boot times), impact of scaling (size of the data center) on performance and power consumption."]}
