He works on the entire computing stack, from server software and operating systems, to networks and processor microarchitecture. His current research projects include FPGA accelerator integration into server environments (e.g., Intel HARP and Microsoft Catapult), FPGA programmability (e.g., virtual memory and high-level synthesis), accelerators for machine learning (e.g., convolutional neural networks), efficient network processing and software-defined networking, speculative performance and energy-enhancing techniques for high-performance processors, and programming models and mechanisms for emerging memory technologies (e.g., HBM and 3D XPoint)."]}
