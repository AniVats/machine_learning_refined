The main emphasis is on approaches that scale well for realistic applications. My most notable contributions are in: Establishing a noncommutative Cayley-Hamilton theorem for finite automata; Showing that minimal nondeterministic finite automata may be related via linear transformations; Automatically detecting emergent properties in networks of cardiac myocytes; Automatically learning an efficient model for excitable cells; Defining a model checking technique that allows to trade time and space for precision and confidence; Defining compositional models for discrete and hybrid hierarchic automata, together with modular proof rules and search routines; Providing compositional semantics and refinement rules for UML sequence diagrams, and their automatic translation to statecharts; Providing an algebraic foundation of UML-RT in terms of trace categories; Giving a denotational semantics for dynamically reconfigurable systems."]}
