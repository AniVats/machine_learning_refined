With his collaborators, David systematically develops discrete theories and computational algorithms in the interdisciplinary field: Computational Conformal Geometry, and apply them for solving real problems, such as global surface parameterization in graphics, deformable shape registration in vision, manifold spline in geometric modeling, curvature convergence analysis in geometric processing, efficient routing in networking, brain mapping and virtual colonoscopy in medical imaging, and so on."]}
