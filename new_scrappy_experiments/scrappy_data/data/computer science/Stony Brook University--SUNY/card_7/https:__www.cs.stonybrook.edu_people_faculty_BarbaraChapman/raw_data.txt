Her research group created the state-of-the-art OpenUH compiler that enabled practical experimentation with parallel language extensions and the corresponding implementation techniques. The group also created a reference implementation of the library-based OpenSHMEM programming interface. Dr. Chapman has co-authored over 200 papers and two books. She obtained a B.Sc. with 1st Class Honours in Mathematics from the University of Canterbury and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Queen\u2019s University of Belfast.Much of Dr. Chapman's current research is focused on OpenMP, a recent industry standard for shared memory parallel programming that has been broadly accepted by the computing community.
