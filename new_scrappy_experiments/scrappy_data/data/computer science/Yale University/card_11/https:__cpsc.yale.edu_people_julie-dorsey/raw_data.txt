Her contributions also include algorithms for lighting and acoustical design and visualization. She is particularly well known for her research in modeling the appearance of materials \u2013 for example, she pioneered techniques to model the visual richness of irregular metal patinas and eroded stone. Her current research interests include photorealistic image synthesis, material and texture models, illustration techniques, and interactive visualization of complex scenes, with an application to urban environments."]}
