Fischer is widely known for his work on the distributed consensus problem and for his \u201cparallel prefix\u201d algorithm that forms the basis of the \u201cscan\u201d operation fundamental to many parallel algorithms. Fischer directed one of the first Ph.D. dissertations on secure and verifiable e-voting (in the mid-1980\u2019s) and has developed information-theoretically secure cryptosystems based on random card deals. Fischer is currently studying trust from an algorithmic point of view with a goal of allowing e-commerce systems to automatically learn and utilize necessary trust relationships."]}
