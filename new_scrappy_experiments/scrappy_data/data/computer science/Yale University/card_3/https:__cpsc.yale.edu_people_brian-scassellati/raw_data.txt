Many scientists have used computer simulations to model complex interactions of neural function, sensory processing, and motor control. Scassellati believes that robotics offers a new kind of tool in investigating human behavior. By building robotic systems based on models of human intelligence, the full complexity of real world environments can be used in evaluating these models. This research integrates work from artificial intelligence, machine vision, classical robotics, psychology, cognitive science, and human-machine interfaces."]}
