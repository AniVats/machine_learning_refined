His latter research focuses are on end-to-end network congestion control and secure multicast. For congestion control, his research has spanned the life cycle of congestion control: design of new congestion control scheme, characterization of congestion control protocols, evaluation of the impacts of congestion control on emerging multimedia applications, and extension of unicast congestion control to multicast congestion control. For secure multicast, he is one of the main developers of keygem, a multicast group key management system that implements scalable and reliable rekeying.Yang is currently interested in the problems of network congestion control and group key management in the context of wireless and mobile networks as well as a network under denial of service attack. Given his past experience, he also follows closely the researches in artificial intelligence and database."]}
