The goal of my research is to understand how we can build interactive computing technologies that are meaningful, intuitive, and appropriate for users, especially in complex social environments. My research often crosses the boundaries between Human-Robot and Human-Computer Interaction, and combines elements from robotics, machine learning, social science, and design.my research group at Yale ICRA week. New paper! Fun debates on the future of robotics research."]}
