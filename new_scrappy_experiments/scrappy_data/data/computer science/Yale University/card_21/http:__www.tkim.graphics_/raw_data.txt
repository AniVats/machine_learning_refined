To reduce such costs, several methods have been developed in which high-resolution turbulence is synthesized as a post process.\nSince global motion can then be obtained using a fast, low-resolution simulation, less effort is needed to create a realistic animation with the desired behavior.\nWhile much research has focused on accelerating the low-resolution simulation, the problem controlling the behavior of the turbulent, high-resolution motion has received little attention. \nIn this paper, we show that \nNon-linear hyperelastic energies play a key role in capturing the fleshy appearance of virtual characters. Real-world, volume-preserving biological tissues have Poisson's ratios near 1/2, but numerical simulation within this regime is notoriously challenging. In order to robustly capture these visual characteristics, we present a novel version of Neo-Hookean elasticity. Our model maintains the fleshy appearance of the Neo-Hookean model, exhibits superior volume preservation, and is robust to extreme kinematic rotations and inversions. We obtain closed-form expressions for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of all of the system's components, which  allows us to directly project the Hessian to semi-positive-definiteness, and also leads to insights into the numerical behavior of the material. These findings also inform the design of more sophisticated hyperelastic models, which we explore by applying our analysis to Fung and Arruda-Boyce elasticity. We provide extensive comparisons against existing material models.\n  \n        This course aims at giving an overview and providing practical guide to employing turbulence modeling techniques for fluid simulations in computer graphics. After reviewing the basics of fluid solvers, and the popular wavelet turbulence approach, we will present several powerful methods to capture advanced effects such as boundary layers, and turbulence with directional preferences. In addition, the difficulties of liquid simulations will be explained, and an approach for liquid turbulence that is based on wave dynamics will be presented.\n        \n    Turing first theorized that many biological patterns arise through the processes of reaction and diffusion. Subsequently, reaction-diffusion systems have been studied in many fields, including computer graphics. We first show that for visual simulation purposes, reaction-diffusion equations can be made unconditionally stable using a variety of straightforward methods. Second, we propose an anisotropy embedding that significantly expands the space of possible patterns that can be generated. Third, we show that by adding an advection term, the simulation can be coupled to a fluid simulation to produce visually appealing flows. Fourth, we couple fast marching methods to our anisotropy embedding to create a painting interface to the simulation. Unconditional stability to maintained throughout, and our system runs at interactive rates. Finally, we show that on the Cell processor, it is possible to implement reaction-diffusion on top of an existing fluid solver with no significant performance impact."]}
