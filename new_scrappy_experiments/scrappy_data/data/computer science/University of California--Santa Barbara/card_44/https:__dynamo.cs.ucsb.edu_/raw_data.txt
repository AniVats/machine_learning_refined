There has been an explosion of data of widely diverse types, arising from genome-wide characterization of transcriptional profiles, protein-protein interactions, genomic structure, genetic phenotype, gene interactions, gene expression, and\u00a0proteomics. We are developing techniques that can integrate and analyze data from multiple sources and models efficiently in order to infer gene and network function.\u00a0<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Research in systems biology has shown that clinical outcomes, such as susceptibility to cancer, depend not only on the expression level of a single protein, but on pathways or network modules. This can be modeled using a network with dynamic node labels and a global dynamic state; the node labels indicate the protein expression levels of an individual and the global state indicates the presence or absence of the disease. To predict the biological outcome or to categorize an individual, we need to find the sub-networks whose local states accurately predict the global network state. Learning discriminative\u00a0</span>subgraphs<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">\u00a0is key to understanding the complex relationship that exists between the local and the global states. Furthermore, they provide the platform for higher-order modeling tasks such as network regularization, classification, and regression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">These efforts on biological network analysis are being augmented by a unique distributed digital library of bio-molecular image data. Such searchable databases will make it possible to optimally understand and interpret the data, leading to a more complete and integrated understanding of cellular structure, function, and regulation.</span>\n\n\n \n</section>\n\n<div class=\"region region-sidebar-second sidebar\"><div class=\"region-inner clearfix\"><section class=\"block block-views\" id=\"block-views-news-block-news\"><div class=\"block-inner clearfix\">\n<h2 class=\"block-title\">Recent News</h2>\n<div class=\"block-content content\"><div class=\"view view-news view-id-news view-display-id-block_news view-dom-id-f8b42af475d1e2c8f65a38690e2e4571\">\n<div class=\"view-content\">\n<div class=\"views-row views-row-1 views-row-odd views-row-first\">\n<div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"> <span class=\"field-content\"><a href=\"/news/1417\">Our research appears in UCSB Convergence</a></span> \n<span class=\"views-field views-field-field-date\"> <span class=\"field-content\">(<span class=\"date-display-single\">Feb 25, 2020</span>) </span> </span>\n<span class=\"views-field views-field-body\"> <span class=\"field-content\">Our research on modeling of team dynamics appears in the UCSB Convergence magazine:\u00a0<a href=\"https://issuu.com/convergence/docs/convergence_23_master_12_2_19\">https://issuu.com/convergence/docs/convergence_23_master_12_2_19</a>.\n\n</span> </span> \n<div class=\"views-row views-row-2 views-row-even\">\n<div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"> <span class=\"field-content\"><a href=\"/news/1416\">Ambuj presents at the Inaugural Mind Machine Workshop</a></span> \n<span class=\"views-field views-field-field-date\"> <span class=\"field-content\">(<span class=\"date-display-single\">Feb 20, 2020</span>) </span> </span>\n<span class=\"views-field views-field-body\"> <span class=\"field-content\">Ambuj presents a talk on \"Models for Human-AI Decision Making\" at the\u00a0Inaugural Workshop on Mind and Machine Intelligence:<a href=\"http://https://mind-machine.ucsb.edu/events/all/2020/2020-inaugural-workshop-mind-and-machine-intelligence\">\u00a0https://mind-machine.ucsb.edu/events/all/2020/2020-...</a> <a class=\"views-more-link\" href=\"/news/1416\">more</a></span> </span> \n<div class=\"views-row views-row-3 views-row-odd views-row-last\">\n<div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"> <span class=\"field-content\"><a href=\"/news/1418\">Ambuj discusses the Central Coast Data Science Initiative</a></span> \n<span class=\"views-field views-field-field-date\"> <span class=\"field-content\">(<span class=\"date-display-single\">Feb 04, 2020</span>) </span> </span>\n<span class=\"views-field views-field-body\"> <span class=\"field-content\">Ambuj presents a talk on the Central Coast Data Science Initiative and leads a panel on Data Science at the\u00a0LIMPID/IDEAS Joint Workshop:\u00a0<a href=\"https://bioimage.ucsb.edu/announcements/666\">https://bioimage.ucsb.edu/announcements/666</a>.\n\n</span> </span> \n\n\n</section>\n\n\n<div id=\"footer-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"container clearfix\">\n<footer class=\"clearfix\" id=\"footer\" role=\"contentinfo\">\n<div class=\"region region-footer\"><div class=\"region-inner clearfix\"><div class=\"block block-block no-title\" id=\"block-block-1\"><div class=\"block-inner clearfix\">\n<div class=\"block-content content\">Dynamic Networks: Analysis and Modeling \u2022\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/\">Department of Computer Science</a><br/><a href=\"http://www.ucsb.edu/\">University of California, Santa Barbara</a><br/>\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 The Regents of the University of California, All Rights Reserved.<br/><a href=\"/info\">Site Information</a> \u2022\n<a href=\"http://policy.ucsb.edu/terms_of_use/\">Terms of Use</a> \u2022\n<a href=\"http://policy.ucsb.edu/privacy-notification/\">Privacy</a> \u2022\n<a href=\"/user/login\">User Login</a>\n </footer>"]}
