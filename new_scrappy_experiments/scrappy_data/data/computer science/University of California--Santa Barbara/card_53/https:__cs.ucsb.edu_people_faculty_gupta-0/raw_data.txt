He will be joining the Department of Computer Science at UCSB, as an assistant professor, in Fall 2019. His research involves the design and implementation of systems that solve real-world network operations problems at the intersection of networking, cybersecurity, and machine learning, with a specific focus on flexible and scalable systems for managing production networks. In the past, he built Sonata, a streaming network monitoring system; and SDX, and Internet routing control system. Both these systems are open source and widely used in both industry and academia. Arpit\u2019s work appears at top-tier networking and systems conferences, including ACM SIGCOMM and USENIX NSDI. His work on SDX received the Internet2 Innovation Award, the USENIX NSDI Community Contribution Award, and the ACM SOSR Best Paper Award. Arpit received his Ph.D. in computer science from Princeton University, masters in computer science from NC State University, and B.Tech. in ECE from Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee.\nAs a systems researcher, I design and build easy-to-use, scalable, and deployable systems that solve real-world problems at the intersection of Currently, my research revolves around answering the question,"]}
