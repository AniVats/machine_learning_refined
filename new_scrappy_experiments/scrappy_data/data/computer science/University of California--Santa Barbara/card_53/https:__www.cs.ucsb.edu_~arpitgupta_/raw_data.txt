However, packets in a network carry\n                                           a lot of information which can be used to personally identify users and their online\n                                           behavior. This requires network operators to anonymize packet traces before sharing\n                                           them with other researchers and analysts. Existing tools anonymize packet traces in\n                                           an offline manner, which incurs significant computational, storage, and memory\n                                           overhead---limiting their ability to scale as the volume of the collected packet\n                                           trace increases. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of an\n                                           Online Network Traffic Anonymization System, ONTAS, which can flexibly anonymize\n                                           packet traces in the data plane itself using modern PISA-based programmable switches.\n                                       \n                                       As a systems researcher, I design and build flexible, scalable,\n                                       and deployable systems that solve the real-world problems at the\n                                       intersection of \n                                                      The lessons learned from this dissertation can help us develop\n                                                      next-generation network-management systems. More concretely,\n                                                      unlike existing systems that rely solely on a single device-type,\n                                                      this dissertation shows that designing systems that can pool resources\n                                                      from a heterogeneous set of devices (targets) is critical for building\n                                                      flexible and scalable network-management systems. It also demonstrates\n                                                      that as the networking technologies and protocols evolve rapidly with\n                                                      time, it is imperative to design modular systems that can swiftly\n                                                      catch up with these changes. Finally, this research also illustrates\n                                                      that it is crucial to select strategic locations (e.g., Internet\n                                                      exchange points) for deployment to drive innovations in Internet-wide\n                                                      traffic monitoring and control.\n                                                  \n\n                                   The proliferation of Internet-connected devices, services, and applications makes it\n                                   more critical than ever to make sure that the network they depend on is reliable,\n                                   performant, and secure. At the same time, their increasing complexity and diversity\n                                   have made even simple network management tasks, such as debugging performance or\n                                   detecting attacks, more complicated than ever. Modern network management needs to\n                                   provide operators with better ways to: (1) monitor what is going on in their networks;\n                                   (2) take real-time preventive or corrective actions based on this information,\n                                   to improve reliability, performance, and security of the networks and the services\n                                   that run on them. Achieving these goals given the limited compute and storage\n                                   resources available on modern network devices is challenging.\n\n                                   In my dissertation research, I developed two systems that address the challenges of\n                                   better information gathering, and more flexible control, respectively. They are:\n\n                               \n                                       In both cases, my research focuses on:\n                                       (1) the abstractions that allow operators to express flexible programs for monitoring and control;\n                                       (2) the algorithms and data structures that make the best use of limited compute and storage resources;\n                                       and (3) the systems that glue high-level abstractions to the low-level algorithms.\n                                   \n                                       To keep the networks running, network operators need to monitor a wide range of network\n                                       activities. For example, they need to concurrently detect whether the network is\n                                       under attack and also determine whether there is a device failure in the network.\n                                       This involves extracting multiple features from the traffic data and combining\n                                       them to infer activities of interest in real time. Most existing network monitoring\n                                       systems are either not expressive, i.e., they support an insufficient\n                                       set of monitoring tasks, or they are not scalable, i.e., they fail to scale as\n                                       the traffic volume intensifies and the number of telemetry tasks increases.\n                                       In contrast, to make the 'net' work, network operators require running multiple\n                                       flexible monitoring queries over high-volume networks. My research focuses on\n                                       building a distributed real-time network monitoring system that is both\n                                       \n                                        After determining what events are going on in the network, network operators\n                                        needs to apply reactive fine-grained control actions. My research focuses on\n                                        applying programmatic control for the inter-domain networks settings, where by\n                                        default networks use the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to exchange traffic with\n                                        each other. In my study, I demonstrate that BGP is not suited for applying\n                                        fine-grained control actions. Ideally, one would like to replace BGP with a\n                                        clean-slate solution enabling network-wide programmatic control. However, the\n                                        existing Internet-wide deployment of BGP-speaking routers makes such an approach\n                                        impractical. Thus, the goal of my research was to design and implement an\n                                        incrementally deployable solution that ensures maximal impact with minimal\n                                        deployment overhead while safely interoperating with BGP.\n                                   ;\n                                       and is the de-facto SDX platform used by researchers affiliated with the Endeavour\n                                       (Europe) and IX.BR (Brazil) projects. It was also used by developers, working\n                                       on a project replacing conventional exchange, connecting multiple government\n                                       agencies, with a software-defined exchange.  The software system has also been\n                                       shipped with a commercial product,\n                                       $25M research program\n                        <iframe height='160' width='355' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='https://www.strava.com/athletes/11909057/activity-summary/4bc2a1431213922d77a28c99bcd415a9dbb19378'></iframe>\n\n                            </div>\n                            "]}
