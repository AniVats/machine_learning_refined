Belding is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara.  Prof. Belding's research focuses on mobile and wireless networking, including network performance analysis, and information and communication technologies for development (ICTD).  She is a co-developer of the AODV routing protocol for mobile networks, on which 802.11s and Zigbee technologies are based in part.   The original AODV paper published in WMCSA'99 received the 2018 ACM SIGMOBILE Test of Time Award.  Prof. Belding applies her wireless network expertise to a wide range of contexts, and is particularly interested in improving Internet and cellular accessibility in developing and resource-challenged communities worldwide.  Her ICTD projects have included work in Zambia, South Africa, Mongolia, and refugee camps.  Most recently, she has been working with Native American communities around the US.  She is the founder and director of the Mobility Management and Networking (MOMENT) Laboratory.  Prof. Belding is the author of over 150 technical papers on wireless networking and has served on over 80 conference technical program committees.  She was Vice Chair of the UCSB Computer Science department 2009-15 and 2017-19.  She is currently an Associate Dean and Faculty Equity Advisor in the UCSB College of Engineering.  Prof. Belding is an ACM Fellow and an IEEE Fellow.  She is particularly proud of receiving the UCSB Outstanding Graduate Mentor Award in 2012 and the NCWIT Harrold and Notkin Research and Graduate Mentoring Award in 2015 for her mentorship of graduate students.\nProf. Belding\u2019s main research interests are in mobile and wireless communication networks, including the study of production networks through large trace collection, and the development of solutions to improve network performance and the user experience. Recently studied technologies include wireless LANs, mesh networks, cellular networks, 60 GHz networks, and white spaces spectrum.\u00a0 Prof. Belding\u2019s current work focuses on information and communication technology solutions for the developing world (ICTD).\u00a0 This work includes the analysis of existing networks, and the development of new network architectures and solutions specifically designed for the communities in which she works.\u00a0 Her current work includes a number of projects in sub-Saharan Africa.\u00a0 Her work is highly interdisciplinary, including collaborators from electrical engineering, film and media studies, and communications.\nWatch Professor Belding's introductory research video, "]}
