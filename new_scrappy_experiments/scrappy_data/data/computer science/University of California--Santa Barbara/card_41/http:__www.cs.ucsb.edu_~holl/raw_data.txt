I\n              am particularly interested in novel user interfaces that\n              depart in interesting ways from the normal desktop\n              setting. This includes such fields as augmented reality,\n              virtual reality and other 3D user interfaces;\n              interactive visualization and real-time computer\n              graphics; 3D displays; wearable, situated, ubiquitous,\n              and social computing; adaptive user interfaces; and\n              multi-modal and multimedia computing.\n            "]}
