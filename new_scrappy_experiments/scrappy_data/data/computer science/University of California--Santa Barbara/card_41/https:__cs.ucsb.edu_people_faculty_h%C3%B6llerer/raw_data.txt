At UCSB, he co-directs the Four Eyes Laboratory conducting research in the four I\u2019s of Imaging, Interaction, and Innovative Interfaces. Dr. H\u00f6llerer's research interests lie in the area of human-computer interaction and experimental systems, with a particular focus on augmented and virtual reality, information visualization, 3D displays and interaction, and social and adaptive user interface technologies.\nH\u00f6llerer directs a research group on Imaging, Interaction, and Innovative Interfaces, with a particular focus on the design, implementation, and evaluation of novel user interfaces that have the potential to augment or challenge established paradigms. The group\u2019s research on Augmented Reality includes an agenda on \"Anywhere Augmentation\" that enables mobile computer users to place annotations in 3D space wherever they go. The group\u2019s Virtual Reality and 3D display research includes work on the UCSB Allosphere project, designing and utilizing display, visualization, and multimodal interaction technologies for a three-story surround-view immersive situation room. H\u00f6llerer\u2019s research on visualization methods and technologies is directed towards supporting better analysis and understanding of the vast data amassed by today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s information technologies in globally distributed information networks and the interconnected physical world.\n"]}
