These problems include: message dissemination under the multicasting mode; scheduling structured and parallel processor systems; component placement and wire routing; and problems arising in computational geometry, graphs, partitioning, clustering, covering, code minimization, compression, statistical testing, etc. He published the first set of in-approximability results, as well as numerous classical algorithms and techniques for solving clustering, scheduling, wire routing, computational geometry and graph problems.\n"]}
