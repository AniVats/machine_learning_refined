He has been Professor of Computer Science at the\nOklahoma University (1975-1976)), Penn State University (1976-1979), ITESM (1979-1980),\nUniversity of Texas at Dallas (1980-1984) and the Univesity of California Santa Barbara (1984-2016).\nOn July 1st 2016 he became Professor Emeritus of Computer Science at the University of\nCalifornia, Sanat Barbara.\nIn 2009 Professor Gonzalez became IASTED Fellow for his \"contributions\nto Multicasting Dissemination Algotithms for Parallel and Distributed\nComputing, as well as for his decade long commitment to PDCS and IASTED\".\nProfessor Gonzalez research activity has concentrated\non the development of efficient\n most significant PREVIOUS main research contributions, most significant RECENT research contributions,\nalgorithms for networks.  The is a fundamental problem that\narises when executing program in parallel computer systems.\nSome applications include iterative methods for solving systems\nof linear and non-linear equations, and most dynamic programming\nprocedures, etc.  His research contributions include work in\n\nDr. Gonzalez current research interests are\nthe design of efficient algorithms for multimessage multicasting in\nnetworks,\nscheduling algorithms, message dissemination, parallel and\ndistributed computing,\nand algorithms for partitioning, grouping and covering problems.\n"]}
