His current interest in parallel algorithms involves approximation and numerical techniques on distributed memory systems while his combinatorial interests center around computational geometry, algorithms on strings, bijective methods, and ranking algorithms for combinatorial structures. At present, he is a professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he has been on the faculty since 1985.\n"]}
