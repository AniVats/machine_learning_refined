I enjoy taking theoretical constructs from the literature\n(e.g., cryptography) and carefully applying them to add strong security and\nprivacy properties to computer systems. An example system that I built is\nPopcorn: a Netflix-like media delivery service that serves movies without\nrequiring to know which movies users are requesting!"]}
