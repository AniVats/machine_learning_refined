He is a Professor at UCSB and has also played many consulting roles to private industries over the years. Dr. Wang is an academic researcher with a passion for entrepreneurship and has been involved in a number of start-up activities.\nDr. Wang has published over 120 peer-reviewed papers and hold three patents. Dr. Wang has received funding support from many federal agencies including NSF, NASA, DARPA, US Army, and US Navy, and also from many private companies.\u00a0 Currently, Dr. Wang's research focuses on 3D computer vision, especially in developing robust, efficient and easy-to-use CV algorithms and systems, with a research objective to benefit the society at large instead of just for the CV community. To this end, Dr. Wang's research group develops 3D technologies that use pictures from mass-market, consumer-grade digital cameras, camcorders, and phones without the need of any special equipment, setup, calibration, markers, user training, or manual intervention. In addition to academic research, Dr. Wang founded VisualSize Inc. to offer state-of-the-art 3D technologies to the general public based on his past Army-sponsored academic research.\n"]}
