His research is in Computer Graphics, mainly aimed at rendering photo-realistic visual appearance at real world complexity, building theoretical foundations mathematically and physically to reveal the principles of the visual world. Ling-Qi's research interests include appearance modeling, real-time ray tracing, sampling and reconstruction theory, volumetric scattering and light transport algorithms.\nMy research is in Computer Graphics, mainly aimed at rendering photo-realistic visual appearance at real world complexity, building theoretical foundations mathematically and physically to reveal the principles of the visual world. My research interests include appearance modeling, real-time ray tracing, sampling and reconstruction theory, volumetric scattering and light transport algorithms. I have brought original research topics to Computer Graphics, such as detailed rendering from microstructure and real-time sampling and reconstruction for ray tracing. I have to date published 10 papers, including 6 first authored ACM SIGGRAPH/ACM TOG papers.\n"]}
