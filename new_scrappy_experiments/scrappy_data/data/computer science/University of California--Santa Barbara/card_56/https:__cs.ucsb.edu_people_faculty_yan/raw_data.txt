He holds the Venkatesh Narayanamurti Chair of Computer Science. He received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2006. He was a research staff member at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center between 2006 and 2008. He has been working on modeling, managing, and mining graphs in information networks, computer systems, social media and bioinformatics. His works were extensively referenced, with over 9,000 citations per Google Scholar and thousands of software downloads. He received NSF CAREER Award, IBM Invention Achievement Award, ACM-SIGMOD Dissertation Runner-Up Award, and IEEE ICDM 10-year Highest Impact Paper Award.\nThe primary goal of my lab is to develop fundamental concepts and new principles of data mining, design intelligent algorithms and build scalable systems.\u00a0 Our current work has concentrated on three key areas: Modeling, managing, and mining large-scale, heterogeneous graphs; Structural and statistical analysis of texts and derived applications such as information extraction, question answering, and information trustworthiness; Intelligent solutions to various cross-domain problems in bioinformatics, business intelligence, computer security, computer systems, and social science.\n"]}
