His current research interests include malware analysis, web security, vulnerability assessment, and mobile phone security. He also edited a book on Security and Mobile Agents and authored one on Intrusion Correlation. He has been the Program Chair of the International Symposium on Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection (RAID 2003), of the ISOC Symposium on Network and Distributed Systems Security (NDSS 2009), and of the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy in 2011. He is known for organizing and running an inter-university Capture The Flag hacking contest, called iCTF, that every year involves dozens of institutions around the world. He is a member of IEEE and ACM.\u00a0\nMy research focuses on a number of different topics: how to protect web applications (by finding vulnerabilities before they are deployed and also by detecting web-based attacks), how to detect and block malicious software, and how to develop, test, and evaluate intrusion detection systems.\n"]}
