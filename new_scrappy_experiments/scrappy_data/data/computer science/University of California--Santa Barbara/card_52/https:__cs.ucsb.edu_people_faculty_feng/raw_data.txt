He received his Ph.D. in computer science at UT Austin. His research to date focuses on developing automated programming techniques that combine program synthesis and program analysis to improve software usability, reliability, and security. For instance, Yu has developed systems for tackling security vulnerabilities (FSE'14, NDSS'17, CCS'17), automating complex programming tasks (PLDI'17, POPL'17, PLDI'18), and challenging the limits of existing program analysis (OOPSLA'15, APLAS'15).\nMy interests include programming languages, static program analysis/verification, program synthesis, and security. More specifically, I want to build automated tools to guarantee the desired behavior of a system in a sound, precise and scalable way. I am also interested in applying static analysis to build and break systems, tackle security problems in smartphone.\n"]}
