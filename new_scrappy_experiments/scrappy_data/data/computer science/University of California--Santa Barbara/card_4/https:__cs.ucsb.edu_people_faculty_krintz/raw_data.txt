Recently, my focus has been on using these technologies to faciliate sustainability science and engineering for the domains of agriculture (SmartFarm) and ecology (WTB). My other interests include projects that mentor, support, and encourage young people from underrepresented groups (especially women!) to consider and pursue computer science.\n2008 CRA-W Anita Borg Early Career (BECA) Award for outstanding research and outreach contributions"]}
