My research often comprises of building electronic and/or web-based programmable data collection tools and capturing subjects\u2019 behavior as they interact with these tools.I want to better understand why and how we connect online, especially through the lens of online communities and social media. Specifically, I am interested in designing and using social media tools in novel ways to help us understand new and interesting things about ourselves, our social networks, our communities, and our neighborhoods. My research design approach is anchored in the quantitative end of things, but I also employ some qualitative approaches too.At my core, I am an educator, an engineer, and a social technologist. I design, build, and study systems that support social interactions in online spaces and try to understand what it says about human behavior around technology. I am passionate about teaching technology to EVERYONE and see a continued huge demand by people of different work and educational backgrounds wanting to learn computational technologies like coding, system building, and data analysis. I aim to address all of this as I forge my way through my career in academia.My educational background (before the PhD) is in electrical engineering (EE) and the liberal arts.\u00a0I've worked in industry for over a dozen years - mostly in high speed digital communication system design and marketing. It's nice to go back to a place where intellectual analysis and the pursuit of new knowledge go hand in hand so well.\u00a0My research interests are in the use of information and communication technologies (ICT), including social media tools, as information sources (to tell us about both individuals and organizations) and understanding human behavior around that. Current and past projects include Building communities for transforming social media research using an information extraction and analysis system, dubbed \""]}
