My research often comprises of building electronic and/or web-based programmable data collection tools, capturing subjects\u2019 behavior as they interact with these tools, and often analyze the data using statistical and machine learning methods. I also teach courses in Social Networks, Data Science, and Research Methods in the Communication Department at UCSB. For more information, see http://www.ziadmatni.com.\n"]}
