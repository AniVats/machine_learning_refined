By adapting to the performance fluctuations caused by contention and unexpected resource failure, distributed services can deliver better client response, and distributed user applications can dynamically optimize their execution ``on-the-fly''.\u00a0 Such resource-aware services and applications are keystones of cloud computing -- A web services based approach to building seamless, highly-scalable distributed systems.\u00a0 My work in this burgeoning research area attempts to investigate and define the foundations upon which adaptive system components and applications can be built.\n"]}
