He has done fundamental work in sparse matrix techniques; he was a primary architect and developer of Matlab\u2019s sparse matrix capability and of the SuperLU solver library.\u00a0 Prof. Gilbert\u2019s current research applies linear algebra and sparse matrix methods to emerging discrete problems in the analysis of large graphs and networks using high-performance computation.\n"]}
