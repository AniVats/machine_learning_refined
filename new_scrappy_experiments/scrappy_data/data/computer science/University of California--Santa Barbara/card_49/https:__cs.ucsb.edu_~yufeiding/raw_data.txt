She received her Ph.D. in the Computer Science from North Carolina State University, and B.S. and M.S. in Physics from University of Science and Technology of China and The College of William and Mary respectively. In 2012, she started her Ph.D. study in Computer Science.  Her research interest resides at the intersection of Compiler Technology and (Big) Data Analytics, with a focus on enabling High-Level Program Optimizations for data analytics and other data-intensive applications. Yufei has been actively publishing in major venues in both computer systems and data analytics areas, such as ASPLOS, PLDI, OOPSLA, VLDB, ICDE, and ICML. She was the receipt of NCSU Computer Science Outstanding Research Award in 2016 and Computer Science Outstanding Dissertation Award in 2018.\n<h1><a name=\"research\"></a>Research</h1>\n My research interests lie in the broad fields of domain-specific language design, architecture and compiler optimization, and hardware acceleration (e.g., FPGA, GPU). Our current research focuses on building a high-performance, energy efficient, and high-fidelity programming framework for emerging technologies such as machine learning, deep learning, and quantum computing."]}
