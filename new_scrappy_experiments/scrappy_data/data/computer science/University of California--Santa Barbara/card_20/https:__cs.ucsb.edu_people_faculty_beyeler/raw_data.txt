He has a PhD in Computer Science from UC Irvine as well as a BS in Electrical Engineering and a MS in Biomedical Engineering from ETH Zurich, Switzerland. His research focuses on the development of novel methods and algorithms to interface sight recovery technologies with the human visual system, with the ultimate goal of restoring useful vision to people suffering from severe blindness. Most recently, he was awarded the prestigious Washington Research Foundation Innovation Fellowship, which enabled his early postdoctoral work at UW and led to an NIH K99 Pathway to Independence Award.\nThe 'bionic eye'\u2014so long a dream of the future\u2014is finally becoming a reality with retinal prostheses available in the US and Europe (Fig. 1; over 300 patients implanted). With cortical implants, optogenetic approaches, and stem cell therapy in development, a wide range of sight recovery (SR) options will be available to patients suffering from severe blindness.\nThe goal of my research is therefore:\n"]}
