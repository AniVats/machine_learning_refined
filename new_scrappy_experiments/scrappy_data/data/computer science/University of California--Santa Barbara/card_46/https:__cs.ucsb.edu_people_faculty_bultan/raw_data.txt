He co-chaired the program committees of WS-FM 2010, ATVA 2011, FSE 2012 (the flagship conference of ACM SIGSOFT), and ASE 2013. He served as the vice chair of the Department of Computer Science at UCSB from 2005 to 2009.\u00a0 He was a keynote speaker at CONCUR 2008, MEMOCODE 2008, PASTE 2008, FACS 2012, and FORTE/FMOODS 2013. He received the NSF CAREER award in 2000.\nProf. Bultan's research focuses on automated verification techniques and their application to software. As computer systems become more pervasive, their dependability becomes increasingly important. The size and complexity of the software systems nowadays inevitably lead to errors during both design and implementation phases.\u00a0 Prof. Bultan's research group develops automated verification and analysis techniques that help developers in identifying and eliminating errors in software.\u00a0 Prof. Bultan\u2019s recent research results include string analysis for achieving input validation/sanitization correctness in web applications, data model verification for cloud-based web applications, interaction analysis for service-oriented and distributed systems, and design for verification for concurrent software.\n"]}
