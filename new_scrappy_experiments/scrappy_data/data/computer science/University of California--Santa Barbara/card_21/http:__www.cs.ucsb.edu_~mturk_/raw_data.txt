My research interests are in computer vision and human-computer interaction, largely\n  concerned with using computer vision as an input modality. That means\n  using cameras (and other sensors) to perceive relevant information\n  about people and the world - e.g., identity, facial expression, body movement,\n  gestures, 3D scene structure - and then using this information to improve the interface\n  between humans and computers.\u00a0In recent years, many of the applications have been in augmented reality, and mostly focused on real-time mobile computing environments.
