I have joined the University of Maryland in July 2014 as a CS professor and director of its center for bioinformatics and computational biology (CBCB). My research is focused on developing and harnessing computational systems biology approaches for the genomic analysis and genome scale metabolic modeling (GSMM) of cancer. My lab collaborates with several experimental cancer labs, aiming to utilize computational approaches to jointly gain a network-level integrative view of the systems we study, and predict and test novel drug targets and biomarkers to treat cancer more selectively and effectively. My lab has developed the first GSMM models of metabolism of different human tissues [1], identified the first GSMM-based synthetic lethal drug target to treat renal cancer [2], has been the first to identify synthetic lethal networks in cancer in a genome-wide manner [3], and together with our experimental collaborators, has recently identified the essential role of aspartate in ASS1-deficient tumors [4].", "View Department Office Contacts"]}
