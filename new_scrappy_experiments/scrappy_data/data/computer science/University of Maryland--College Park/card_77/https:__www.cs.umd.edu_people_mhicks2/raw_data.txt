Noteworthy among his research accomplishments is the development of analysis and compilation tools for enabling software to be safely updated without shutting it down. He has explored the design of new programming languages and analysis tools for automatically discovering or remediating software flaws and security vulnerabilities. He has also conducted studies on the utility of defect detection tools according on outcomes of human users, and explored distributed systems design and evaluation, particularly when adaptivity and security are system goals. Recently he has turned his attention to exploring means for securing remote and distributed computations among untrusted parties by combining cryptographic and programming language techniques.", "View Department Office Contacts"]}
