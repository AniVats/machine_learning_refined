He started working on two projects as part of DARPA\u2019s Lifelong Learning Machines (L2M)program (June'18): Context-dependent reconfiguration of an intelligent neural system, STELLAR (Super Turing Evolving Lifelong Learning ARchitecture). He is a mechanical engineer by training (B.Sc. in System Dynamics and Control, M.Sc. in Solid Mechanics and Ph.D. in Manufacturing Engineering), but optimization and its applications in various disciplines have always been in the center of his research interests."]}
