His work on the UNITY methodology, jointly with Mani Chandy, has been influential in both academia and industry, and has spawned a large number of tools and research projects. He and Mani Chandy (and, independently, Randy Bryant) pioneered the area of distributed discrete event simulation. He is currently working on a programming language, called \"Orc,\" for concurrent orchestrations of interacting components.  He is also spear-heading an effort, jointly with Tony Hoare, to automate large-scale program verification."]}
