The SHPC group focuses on applying fundamentals of hardware architecture and computer science towards the goal of creating linear algebra software that is not only portable and maintainable, but that also yields high performance on modern hardware. Aside from numerous publications exploring the science of high-performance algorithms and implementations, he is most known for authoring the BLIS Framework, an open-source, high-performance matrix computation library that has since been adopted by AMD."]}
