In biophysics, his interests are in developing algorithms to extend time scales of simulations. Critical time scales in molecular biophysics cover 15 orders of magnitude, from femtoseconds (light absorption and initiation of vision) to hours (slow permeation processes through membranes). He has developed an algorithm (Milestoning) that extracts information from short-time dynamics and constructs a model for long-time processes. Elber\u2019s theories and algorithms are implemented in the software package MOIL."]}
