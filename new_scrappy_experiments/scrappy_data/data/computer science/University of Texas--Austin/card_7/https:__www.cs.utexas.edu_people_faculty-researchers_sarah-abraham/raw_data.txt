She is a member of the Real-time Graphics and Parallel Systems group, with interests in non-photorealistic rendering, simulation-based tools for artists, and video game mechanics that foster cooperation and empathy. Dr. Abraham received her M.S. and PhD from the University of Texas at Austin, and her B.A. From Wellesley College.Dr. Abraham's research interests are primarily related to video game development and artistic tools. She is interested\u00a0in non-photorealistic rendering, as well as creating artist tools that make physical\u00a0simulation intuitive and accessible. She is currently exploring\u00a0video game mechanics and narrative\u00a0as a vehicle for fostering cooperation and empathy in players."]}
