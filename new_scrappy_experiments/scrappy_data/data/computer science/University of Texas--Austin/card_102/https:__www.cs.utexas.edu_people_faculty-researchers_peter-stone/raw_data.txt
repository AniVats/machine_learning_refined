He considers adaptation, interaction, and embodiment to be essential capabilities of such agents. Thus, his research focuses mainly on machine learning, multiagent systems, and robotics. For him, the most exciting research topics are those inspired by challenging real-world problems. He believes that complete, successful research includes both precise, novel algorithms and fully implemented and rigorously evaluated applications. His application domains have included robot soccer, autonomous bidding agents, autonomous vehicles, autonomic computing, and social agents.  of current research topics.BWIBots: A platform for bridging the gap between AI and human--robot interaction research"]}
