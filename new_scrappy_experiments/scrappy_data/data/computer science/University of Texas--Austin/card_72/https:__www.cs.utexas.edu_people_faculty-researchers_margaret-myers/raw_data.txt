She taught undergraduate and graduate courses in discrete mathematics, linear algebra, probability and statistics, as well as Bayesian Statistics. Her research activities range from informal learning opportunities in mathematics education to formal derivation of linear algebra algorithms.  She was a senior research scientist with the Dana Center. Her partnerships (in marriage and research) with Prof. Robert van de Geijn for decades and survived the development of several MOOCs, including Linear Algebra: Foundations to Frontiers, LAFF-On Programming for  Correctness, LAFF- On Programming for High Performance and an upcoming Advanced Linear Algebra for Computation.\nDr. Myers expertise, educational, and research interests fall in Informal learning opportunities, Mathematics education and curriculum development, application of Bayesian statistical methods to computer science, formal derivation of algorithms, and high performance computing.Current research includes applications of probability and statistical methods to scientific computing and performance."]}
