She received both her M.S. in computer science and her Ph.D. in computer science from this department. Since then, she has been fortunate enough to spend her days teaching systems to undergraduates and performing outreach to underserved communities.\nHer research interests lie in the intersection of supercomputing and program analysis with a special interest in static techniques to improve checkpointing. She is also interested in large-scale simulation.\n"]}
