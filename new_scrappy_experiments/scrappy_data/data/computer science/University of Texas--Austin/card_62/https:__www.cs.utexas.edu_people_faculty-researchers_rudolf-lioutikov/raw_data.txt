His research includes imitation-learning, skill learning, motion segmentation and human-robot interaction for non-experts. During his Ph.D., Rudolf worked on the 3rd Hand Project where he developed and evaluated new approaches in the field of semi-autonomous human-robot collaboration tasks. Combined, the developed methods form an imitation learning pipeline."]}
