Dr. Zhu received his master\u2019s and PhD from Stanford University. His doctoral thesis centers around closing the perception-action loop to make robot intelligence more generalized and applicable to less-controlled environments. As an undergraduate, he received dual degrees from Zhejiang University and Simon Fraser University. Dr. Zhu\u2019s publications have won several awards and nominations, and his work has been covered by media outlets, such as MIT Technology Review and Stanford News. In addition, he\u2019s had research collaborations with Snap Research, Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, and DeepMind Technologies.Dr. Zhu\u2019s research lies at the intersection of robotics, machine learning, and computer vision. He develops computational methods of perception and control that give rise to intelligent robot behaviors. Through his work, Dr. Zhu aspires to teach robots to understand and interact with the surrounding visual world."]}
