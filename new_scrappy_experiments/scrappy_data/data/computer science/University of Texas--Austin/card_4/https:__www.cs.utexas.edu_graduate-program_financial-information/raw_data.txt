These are under the purview of the individual professors and are generally made after the student has been enrolled for at least 1-2 semesters. \u00a0A GRA appointment is typically for 20 hours per week for the semester, and covers the student's tuition, fees and insurance.\u00a0 Most students find a research supervisor during the second or third year and may be supported as research assistants."]}
