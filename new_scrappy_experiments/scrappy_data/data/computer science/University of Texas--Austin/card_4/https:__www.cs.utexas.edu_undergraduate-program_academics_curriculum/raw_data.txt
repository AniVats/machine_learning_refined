The faculty decided that the best response is to reduce the set of classes that students are required to take, so as to enable students to pursue their interests by choosing upper-division elective courses. The old curriculum had eleven CS courses that students were required to take, leaving little time for electives. The new curriculum has only six. This gives students the opportunity to dive into\u00a0concentration areas, or to study computer science more broadly by sampling from various subareas."]}
