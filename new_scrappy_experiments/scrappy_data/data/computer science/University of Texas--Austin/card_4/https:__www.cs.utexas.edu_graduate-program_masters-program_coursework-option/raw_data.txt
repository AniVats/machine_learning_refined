The important thing is that approximately the same material has been covered. The decision about which courses you submit for review meet the background requirements is made by the faculty.\u00a0 The form is submitted to the grad office.\n<strong>The following UTCS undergraduate courses, or equivalent, are required as background*:</strong>\n<ul>Discrete Math for Computer Science (CS 311)\nIntroduction to Programming (CS 312)\nData Structures (CS 314)\nAlgorithms and Complexity (CS 331)\nComputer Organization and Architecture (CS 429)\nPrinciples of Computer Systems (CS 439)\n</ul><strong>Rules </strong>\n<ol>Any background requirements not met at the time of admission must be satisfied while enrolled in the Masters program.\nA common question is whether an undergraduate background requirement can be satisfied by taking the corresponding graduate course.\u00a0 Generally speaking, the corresponding graduate course assumes the undergraduate material as background, and so this approach is not permitted.\u00a0 That said, exceptions to this general rule are sometimes granted.\u00a0 A student seeking an exception should consult with the faculty member teaching the corresponding graduate course.\nOne upper-division background course taken at UTCS as a graduate student may count towards your CS Major coursework.\u00a0\n</ol><strong>How to Complete Background Requirements </strong>\n<ol>Complete an undergraduate degree with a major in Computer Science prior to joining our graduate program; OR\nCoursework that covers the background topics through any combination of:\n<ul>Courses taken prior to admission.\nBackground courses named above may be taken at UTCS as a graduate student. An overall GPA of 3.50 on courses taken at UTCS is required unless only 1 course is taken, in which case the requirement is for a 3.0 in that single class.\nStudent receives a B or better on Final exam(s) of UTCS undergraduate background courses.\n</ul>\n</ol>*Students who first enrolled prior to Fall 2016 may choose to graduate under the new rules above or fulfill the previous background requirements.\u00a0 Please see the <a href=\"https://www.cs.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Background%20Crswk%20Form%20pre-2016.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">pre-2016 background coursework form </a>and <a href=\"https://www.cs.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Pre-2016%20Program%20of%20work%20Form%20No%20thesis-No%20Report.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">checklist</a> for a list of previous background coursework."]}
