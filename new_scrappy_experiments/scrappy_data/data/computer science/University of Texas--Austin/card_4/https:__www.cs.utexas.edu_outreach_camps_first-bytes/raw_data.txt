Creating a project with a team of other girls gave me the opportunity to understand that CS is a challenging but rewarding field. I also really enjoyed my visit to VMware, a software company in Austin, because it was the first time I was exposed to a working environment, and I was able to picture myself in a similar setting a few years down the road.First Bytes is an amazing experience for high school girls interested in studying CS. As a former participant and later a Residential Assistant, I\u2019ve been able to witness the transformative experience twice over. It\u2019s amazing to see the ways that campers grow in confidence over the week, working together in teams to program and develop a project of their own. Girls have the ability to learn about the various facets of CS, learning from expert researchers and industry professionals. I can say confidently that First Bytes contributed to my decision to major in Computer Science and attend UT, and I am thankful\u00a0to have participated in/worked with such a wonderful program.Before attending First Bytes, I knew I was interested in coding but was unaware of the applications of computer science as a career. In just one week, First Bytes exposed me to a multitude of career options involving CS including architecture, the CIA and game design. Being introduced to all these focuses got me thinking about my future occupation, and motivated me to do research in topics I found especially interesting like computational neuroscience. Learning about the variety of specialties within CS made me want to go into research and proved to be the most impactful part of First Bytes."]}
