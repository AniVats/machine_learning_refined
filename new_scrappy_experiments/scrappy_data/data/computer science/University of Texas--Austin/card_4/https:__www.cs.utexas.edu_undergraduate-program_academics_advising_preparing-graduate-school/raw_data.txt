Learning about the cutting-edge of the field and possibly doing research that moves the field forward can be very rewarding. Students often have questions about graduate school and hopefully this page and the associated links will help you figure out if graduate school is for you.That depends on your field. In computer science, the primary graduate degrees are the Masters (MA or MS) and the Doctorate (PhD) in computer science. The Masters degree is comprised primarily of coursework that builds on your undergraduate work and better prepares you for industry or further graduate studies. It may involve writing a thesis. The Doctorate moves past the Masters course work to individual research in a specific area of computer science. A PhD is required for a career in academia. It also can prepare you for a career in industrial research. Some PhD programs require a Masters degree before you can be admitted; others accept students who have completed just a Bachelors degree.Your other CS experiences, including internships and researchGraduate admission committees are looking for students who are likely to succeed in research. The best way to convince them that you are one of those students is to get involved in research as an undergraduate. \u00a0more on how to get involved in researchDocumenting research requires technical writing skills. Students considering graduate school may want to prepare by enrolling for CS 234 - Technical Writing. This is a small class with lots of opportunity for individual attention that will help satisfy your substantial writing component requirement."]}
