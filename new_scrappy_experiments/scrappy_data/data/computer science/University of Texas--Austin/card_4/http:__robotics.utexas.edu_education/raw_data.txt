The robotics certification expands the opportunities for graduating students looking for academic and/or research positions related to robotics in any department. The program will highlight their interdisciplinary skills spanning multiple disciplines beyond their degreed department. provides graduate students the opportunity to obtain an official \"certification of expertise\" in\u00a0robotics with their Masters or Ph.D. degree from their home departments. Students in the portfolio program will receive multidisciplinary training in robotics by completing core coursework offered by the Department of Computer Science and\u00a0the Department of Mechanical Engineering. Students must also participate\u00a0in research seminars and complete additional approved courses offered by participating departments (below is a list of core and approved courses). The portfolio program aims to create a student-led research community in robotics at UT Austin and to promote interdisciplinary interaction among students.a one-page research proposal, anda letter of support from the student\u2019s research supervisor. Once admitted, certification requires completion of four courses (12 semester hours) in robotics and participation in at least two semesters of a Research Seminar Series. Selected courses must have been approved by the Portfolio Steering Committee . \u00a0At least 2 of the 4 courses must be core course from different departments. Additionally, no more than 2 of the 4 courses can be from the same department.\u00a0The research seminar series is a non-credit, bi-weekly seminar series.
