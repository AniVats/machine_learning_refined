UTCS is renowned for educational excellence, as a leading-edge research center, and is a critical economic force for Central Texas. UTCS\u2019s estimated economic impact to the growth of Texas is $8.7 billion annually (The Perryman Group, an economic consulting firm).The state share of the university\u2019s budget is shrinking even as UT Austin pursues its most ambitious goal yet \u2014 to be the best public research university in the nation.The majority of funding for UT Austin comes from sources other than the state of Texas. State funding alone is not what makes The University of Texas a university of the first class. But thanks to private support, UT drives economic, social, and cultural progress as one of the world\u2019s most powerful centers of learning, research, and creativity."]}
