Your long-term career goal may be to become a software engineer, an entrepreneur, a professor, an industrial researcher, or a patent attorney. Regardless, an undergraduate research experience can be an eye-opening and rewarding experience.\nResearch involves:\n<ul>Being innovative\nAccepting responsibility\nTaking risks\nBasking in the glow of a new result\n</ul><h2>How to get involved in research:</h2>\nUT encourages all its students to get involved in research. The College of Natural Sciences has created a web page to help science students find\u00a0<a href=\"https://cns.utexas.edu/innovative-education/undergraduate-research\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"line-height:normal\">research opportunities</a>. There are two ways to begin your research at UT:\n<ul>Take a\u00a0<a href=\"https://cns.utexas.edu/fri\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"line-height:normal\">Freshman Research Initiative</a>\u00a0(FRI) course.\n<a href=\"https://eureka.utexas.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"line-height:normal\">EUREKA</a>\u00a0is a UT-wide effort to encourage undergraduate research. Check their site for additional opportunities.\nFind a faculty member and begin working on a project. Students generally do this during their junior and/or senior year, but there are opportunities for talented sophomores as well. Many faculty members require that students have taken one of their courses before joining their research teams. So you should start early to think about the area(s) you might want to do research in. Then take the relevant classes.\n</ul>"]}
