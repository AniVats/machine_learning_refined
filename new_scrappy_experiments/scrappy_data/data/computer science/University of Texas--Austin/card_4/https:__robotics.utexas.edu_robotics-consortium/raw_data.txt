Four top ten ranked departments house our core faculty: Computer\u00a0Science; Mechanical Engineering; Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics; and\u00a0Electrical and Computer Engineering. The University has dedicated significant resources to\u00a0support and expand robotics at UT, including funding the renovation of the Anna Hiss\u00a0Gymnasium, which will become the new home for Texas Robotics; and the hiring of 8 new\u00a0faculty members, which will result in doubling the original size of our core faculty. Additionally,\u00a0our Graduate Portfolio Program in Robotics both enables students to\u00a0attain a certification for\u00a0their robotics expertise on their diplomas and provides a bi-weekly seminar series accessible to\u00a0consortium members. We are building on our team\u2019s already exceptional track record for\u00a0producing world-class research to emerge as one of the world\u2019s top robotics groups.\n\nTexas Robotics\u2019 Industrial Affiliate Program, the Robotics Consortium, forges close relationships\u00a0between robotics students and researchers at UT Austin and our natural partners in industry. It\u00a0fuels growth by creating an exchange in which affiliate partners benefit from access to cutting\u00a0edge research and top talent while University researchers gain a clear understanding of the\u00a0real-world challenges confronting our partners. Membership in this program is about creating\u00a0the future of robotics at UT Austin and beyond. Opportunities include directed research, a\u00a0unique program of embedded researchers in groups within the consortium, premier access for\u00a0recruitment, and more.\n<h3>ROBOTICS RESEARCH</h3>\nTexas Robotics conducts world-class research in areas including:<br/>\n\u00b7 General Purpose Autonomy<br/>\n\u00b7 Robotics in Hazardous Environments<br/>\n\u00b7 Autonomous Off-Road Vehicles<br/>\n\u00b7 Assisted Rehabilitation<br/>\n\u00b7 Robotic Surgery<br/>\n\u00b7\u00a0Reinforcement Learning<br/>\n\u00b7 Autonomous Systems<br/>\n\u00b7 Human Robot Interaction<br/>\n\u00b7 Multiagent Systems\n \n</article>\n\n<aside class=\"l-region l-region--sidebar-second\">\n<div class=\"block block--block block--block-27\" id=\"block-block-27\">\n<div class=\"block__content\">\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #eee; padding:10px;width:95%;margin-bottom:20px\">", " <div id=\"testbtn\" style=\"width:50px;height:50px;background:red\" class=\"btn clickable\">x</div> "]}
