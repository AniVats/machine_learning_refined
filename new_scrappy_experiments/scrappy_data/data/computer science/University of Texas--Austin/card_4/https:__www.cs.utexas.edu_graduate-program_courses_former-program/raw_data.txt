Our Ph.D. students also take courses, which give them the foundation on which to build their research programs. But the overriding goal of the Ph.D. program is to show students how to do outstanding research. We expect all our Ph.D. students to become involved in research within their first semester here (see Research Immersion below) and continue their involvement throughout their time at UT. To get a good feeling for the way in which our Ph.D. students are involved in our research activities, browse our research web pages.As a consequence of early immersion in research, our Ph.D. students are often already recognized in the wider research community well before they graduate. They regularly travel to conferences, present papers, and sometimes receive best paper awards.Students must have an undergraduate degree in computer science or an allied field such as engineering or math with appropriate CS background to be admitted into the Ph.D. program. Each student who is admitted must then satisfy the following requirements:Doctoral students are required to enroll in a special research course CS 398T during their first semester in the program. (Students entering in Spring will be required to take this course the following Fall.) As part of this class, students will be expected to find a research supervisor with whom the student will work throughout the first year.All doctoral students are required to enroll in and complete a research course, CS 395, each semester until they advance to candidacy.Doctoral students may not enroll for 12 or more hours unless they receive special permission from the Graduate Advisor. Such permission is granted rarely and only based on written justification from the student's research supervisor.Students satisfy this requirement by taking a set of at least 3 courses related to their particular research interests. At most one of these courses may be outside the Computer Sciences Department; they are usually chosen from the Each student must prepare a written dissertation proposal and then give an oral public presentation of the proposal. This will normally happen soon after the RQ document is filed. The student must, at this point, assemble a tentative dissertation committee that has been approved by the graduate advisor. Be sure what you send to the graduate adviser for approval includes a short description of your dissertation and what role you foresee for each proposed committee member in helping you reach your research goals. The approved committee will examine the student on the proposal. If they are unanimously satisfied that the proposed work, if substantially completed, would constitute an acceptable dissertation and that the student has the potential for substantially completing the work, then they will recommend admission to candidacy. Admission to candidacy must be approved by the Department's Graduate Studies Committee and the Graduate School.Each student must write a dissertation that describes original research and submit it to the members of his/her committee. There are many  of the dissertation research. When the committee is satisfied with the dissertation, they will so inform the Graduate School."]}
