If these are not the UTCS background courses listed above, certification by an appropriate member of the UTCS tenure-track faculty is required.\nBackground courses named above (or the equivalent honors courses) may be taken at UTCS as a graduate student. An overall GPA of 3.50 on courses taken at UTCS is required unless only 1 course is taken, in which case the requirement is for a 3.0 in that single class. A grade of B or better on the final exam in a background course may be substituted for a full course grade with certification by an appropriate member of the UTCS Tenure-track faculty.\nCourses certified by appropriate UTCS tenure-track faculty as covering equivalent material may be taken at UTCS or elsewhere by our graduate students. Certification must be obtained prior to taking the course. Note that this does not empower students to register for UTCS graduate courses if they do not meet the prerequisites for admission to those courses.\n</ul>\nUTCS faculty may certify a student as having covered required background material by interrogating the student\u2019s knowledge of the material directly.\n</ul>Students who first enrolled prior to Fall 2016 may choose to graduate under the new rules above or fulfill the previous background requirements.\u00a0 Please see the <a href=\"https://www.cs.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Background%20Crswk%20Form%20pre-2016.pdf\">pre-2016 background coursework form</a> for a list of previous background coursework.\n<h3>Research Immersion</h3>\nEvery Ph.D. student is expected to spend a substantial amount of time on research, starting from the first semester. Doctoral students are required to enroll in a special research course CS 398T during their first semester in the program. (Students entering in Spring will be required to take this course the following Fall.) As part of this class, students will be expected to find a research supervisor with whom the student will work throughout the first year; each Ph.D. student must always have a research supervisor.\nIn each subsequent semester, until admission to candidacy, a Ph.D. student must enroll in and complete a CS 395 Conference Course (research course) with a research supervisor. Please submit the necessary <a href=\"https://login.cs.utexas.edu/graduate-program/forms\">form</a> to the graduate office at the start of each semester.\nDoctoral students may not enroll for 12 or more hours unless they receive special permission from the Graduate Advisor. Such permission is rarely granted."]}
