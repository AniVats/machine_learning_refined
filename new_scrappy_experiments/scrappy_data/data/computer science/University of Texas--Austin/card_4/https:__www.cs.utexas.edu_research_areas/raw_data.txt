It also includes systems built on provable properties. Besides such technologies, which provide demonstrable defense against concrete attacks, we also work on demonstrating security flaws in systems that are thought to be secure. In other words, we also like to break things.Our research focuses on the theoretical foundations of computer science and related applications. Our methods frequently rely on rigorous mathematical proofs."]}
