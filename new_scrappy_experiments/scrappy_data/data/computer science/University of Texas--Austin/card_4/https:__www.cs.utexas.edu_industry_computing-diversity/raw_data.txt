The program is designed to dispel preconceptions about computer science and to encourage young men and women from underrepresented populations to pursue computer science. The camp admits approximately 60 students each summer and provides opportunities to learn a programming language, network with successful computer scientists from similar backgrounds in both the academic and corporate eld, visit research labs, explore careers in computer science, and experience life on a college campus. Through Code Longhorn, Texas Computer Science seeks to increase the number of students from underrepresented groups entering the computer science eld and to build a talent pipeline for industry."]}
