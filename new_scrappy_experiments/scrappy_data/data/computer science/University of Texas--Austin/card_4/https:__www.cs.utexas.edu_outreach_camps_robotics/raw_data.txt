These are no longer just ideas waiting to happen. The future is now!\u00a0\u00a0At the Texas Computer Science\u00a0Robotics summer camp, you\u2019ll work with this exciting technology, building a robot from the ground up and learning about artificial intelligence and its applications. You\u2019ll see 3-D printers, hear from faculty and industry who are inventing the future and meet other like-minded students like yourself who want to change the world one byte at a time. There\u2019s never been a better time to immerse yourself in the world of computer science and learn what Texas Computer Science\u00a0has to offer."]}
