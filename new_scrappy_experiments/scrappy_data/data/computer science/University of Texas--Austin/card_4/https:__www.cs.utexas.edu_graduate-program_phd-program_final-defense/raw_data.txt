There are many resources available to assist in writing a dissertation. The student will then give a public presentation of the dissertation research. This is called the defense. When the committee is satisfied with the dissertation (there are usually some rewrites), they will inform the Graduate School. This is done by submitting the \u2018Report of Dissertation Committee\u2019 (formerly known as the \u2018gold\u2019 form) signed by all committee members present at the defense. The \u2018Report of Dissertation Committee\u2019 form is sent to the research supervisor before the defense.\n<h3>First 12 class days</h3>\nVerify your registration in _99W. You are expected to be in the W section of dissertation the semester you defend."]}
