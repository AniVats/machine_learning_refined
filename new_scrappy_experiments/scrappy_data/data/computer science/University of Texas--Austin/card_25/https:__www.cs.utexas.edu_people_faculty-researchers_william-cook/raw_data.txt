He is currently developing constructs for distributed and data-centric computing in order to eventually develop a theory of model-driven development that enables integration of multiple domain-specific languages needed to build complex interactive software systems, including user interfaces, distributed workflow orchestration, authorization policies, and data/synchronization models."]}
