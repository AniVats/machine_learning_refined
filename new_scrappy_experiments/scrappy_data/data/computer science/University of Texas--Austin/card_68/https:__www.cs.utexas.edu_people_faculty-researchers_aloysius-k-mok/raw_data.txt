His primary concerns include specification techniques for real-time systems, algorithms for guaranteeing stringent timing constraints and understanding the trade-off between the robustness and response times of time-critical systems. The goal is to develop a formal framework for automating the analysis and synthesis of robust real-time systems. Application areas include robot control systems, avionics software and industrial process control systems. Funding is being provided by the Office of Naval Research to develop a highly automated design environment for real-time systems."]}
