She received her Ph.D. in Electrical and Systems Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania in 2008 and has been at Cornell since 2009. Her research focuses on formal methods for robotics and automation and more specifically on creating verifiable robot controllers for complex high-level tasks using logic, verification, synthesis, hybrid systems theory and computational linguistics. She received an NSF CAREER award in 2010, a DARPA Young Faculty Award in 2012 and the Fiona Ip Li '78 and Donald Li '75 Excellence in teaching award in 2013.</section><section aria-labelledby=\"nf-b-1535\" class=\"section--faculty-detail faculty-detail__biography\"><h2 id=\"nf-b-1535\">Research Interests</h2>Robotics, Motion Planning, Task Planning, Model Checking, Verification, Hybrid Systems, Language for Robotics, Human Robot Interaction, Modular Robots.<ul><a href=\"/robotics\" hreflang=\"en\">Robotics</a><a href=\"/research-and-faculty/strategic-areas-research/complex-systems-network-science-and-computation\" hreflang=\"en\">Complex Systems, Network Science and Computation</a></ul></section><section aria-labelledby=\"nf-e-1535\" class=\"section--faculty-detail faculty-detail__publications\">"]}
