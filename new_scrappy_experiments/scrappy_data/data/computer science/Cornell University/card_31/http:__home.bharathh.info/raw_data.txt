I want to build systems that understand the visual world as well as people do. Currently, I am working on building systems that can learn about tens of thousands of visual concepts with very little or no supervision, produce rich and detailed outputs such as precise 3D shape, and reason about the world and communicate this reasoning to humans."]}
