Although several strategies and technological approaches have been proposed for emotion regulation, they often require\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconscious attention and effort. This often limits their efficacy in practice. In this project, we propose a different approach inspired by self-perception theory: noticing that people are often reacting to the perception of their own behavior, we artificially change their perceptions to influence their emotions. We conducted two studies to evaluate the potential of this approach by automatically and subtly altering how people perceive their own voice. In one study, participants that received voice feedback with a calmer tone during relationship conflicts felt less anxious. In the other study, participants who listened to their own voices with a lower pitch during contentious debates felt more powerful. The results of these studies show the potential of automatic and less perceptible emotion regulation systems.", "Alertness is a crucial component of our cognitive performance. Reduced alertness can negatively impact our memory consolidation, productivity and safety. To better track the ebb and flow of our alertness,  we propose AlertnessScanner, a computer vision based system that collects in-situ pupil information to model alertness in the wild. We conducted two in-the-wild studies to evaluate the effectiveness of our solution, and we found that AlertnessScanner can assess alertness in a passive and unobtrusive way. As such, with AlertnessScanner installed on our phone, it can help track our alertness and we can better schedule our routine.", "This project aims to develop new approaches to assess and improve everyday job performance and wellbeing using mobile sensor data,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttheoretically-grounded models and efficient software implementations.", "Photoacoustic effect is a fundamental physics concept which is essentially the generation of sound due to the absorption of intensity modulated light or more generally EM waves by a certain material. We took this fundamental physics concept to build a mobile sensing system that can characterize the quality or nutritional characteristics of liquid food. The long-term vision of this work is to democratize food characterization using such a low cost, easy to use, mobile system which could enable consumers to test food before purchase and to put an indirect pressure on the food industry and government regulators to ensure quality. This work made the following contributions: (1) Proving the fundamental concept of the theory of photoacoustic effect with step-by-step experimentation. (2) Design and Implementation of a low-cost mobile photoacoustic sensing system. (3) Implementation of the signal processing and machine learning algorithm for liquid food characterization. (4) Evaluation of Nutrilyzer for milk protein concentration, milk adulterants, and alcohol concentration characterization.", "Researchers have devised different interventions to help users regulate their emotions. However, many of the current interventions require a lot of attention and effort from the users, which may affect their concentration during ongoing tasks and even increase their stress. Therefore, a crucial question that arises is: How to design mobile interventions that can help users to regulate their emotions in real-time, without compromising their behavior or cognition?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn this project we argue that it is possible to do that by developing mobile interventions that focus on implicit emotion regulation, in which users are able to regulate their emotions without the need for conscious supervision or explicit intentions. In particular, previous studies show that the way we perceive our bodily signals can directly influence our emotional experience. Inspired by these previous studies we designed and built EmotionCheck, which is a watch-like device that can help users to regulate their anxiety by changing their perception of their own heart rate in a subtle way.", "Food and branding research groups have leveraged illusions to alter individuals perception of serving size, resulting in the individuals serving themselves smaller food portions. One method is using smaller plates or serving utensils, which causes individuals to serve smaller portions of food. This is due to a perception bias that causes individuals to perceive that there is more food on the plate due to the amount of surface area covered or that they have served more. By leveraging one of these illusions we built a persuasive technology that create the illusion that there is more food on a plate than there actually is, which could influence how much food users serve themselves. ", "We often think of ourselves as individuals with steady capabilities. However, converging strands of research indicate that this is not the case --- our biochemistry varies significantly over the course of a 24 hour period; and consequently our levels of alertness, productivity, physical activity, and even sensitivity to pain can vary according to the time of day. This project focuses on identifying novel measurements and interventions that can leverage these daily variations. Our findings demonstrate that phone usage patterns can be used to detect and predict individual daily variations indicative of temporal preference, sleep deprivation, and the effects of social jet lag.Being able to unobtrusively measure biological misalignments means there is also an opportunity for technology to play to our biological strengths. Incorporating an awareness of individual biochemical variations could have a significant impact on a wide range of technologies and help support increased well-being, productivity, and higher quality of sleep.", "Early detection of mental health changes in individuals with serious mental illness is critical for effective intervention. CrossCheck is the first step towards the passive monitoring of mental health indicators in patients with schizophrenia and paves the way towards relapse prediction and early intervention.", "Motivated by the need to support those managing chronic pain, we report on the iterative design, development, and evaluation of Keppi, a novel pressure-based tangible user interface (TUI) for the self-report of pain intensity. In-lab studies with 28 participants found individuals were able to use Keppi to reliably report low, medium, and high pain as well as map squeeze pressure to pain level. Based on insights from these evaluations, we ultimately created a wearable version of Keppi with multiple form factors, including a necklace, bracelet, and keychain. Interviews indicated high receptivity to the wearable design, which satisfied additional user-identified needs (e.g., discreet and convenient) and highlighted key directions for the continued refinement of tangible devices for pain assessment.", "DoppleSleep is a contactless sleep sensing system that continuously and unobtrusively tracks sleep quality using commercial off-the-shelf radar modules. DoppleSleep provides a single sensor solution to track sleep- related physical and physiological variables including coarse body movements and subtle and fine-grained chest, heart movements due to breathing and heartbeat. By integrating vital signals and body movement sensing, DoppleSleep achieves 89.6% recall with Sleep vs. Wake classification and 80.2% recall with REM vs. Non-REM classification compared to EEG-based sleep sensing. Lastly, it provides several objective sleep quality measurements including sleep onset latency, number of awakenings, and sleep efficiency. The contactless nature of DoppleSleep obviates the need to instrument the user\u2019s body with sensors. Lastly, DoppleSleep is implemented on an ARM microcontroller and a smart- phone application that are benchmarked in terms of power and resource usage.", "Mobile phone based behavior change applications have shown great promise for health management over the years. Many of these applications either operate by prescribing generic suggestions or require direct intervention from a specialist to personalize. Generic suggestion based systems often fail to personalize to user's context, and providing personalized specialist feedback is impossible to achieve at scale. However, with development of mobile phone based activity recognition research, it is now possible to understand individual user behavior and context at scale. In this paper, we propose a mobile phone based suggestion engine that learn user's physical activity and food intake behavior, and adapt suggestion accordingly. A lightweight Bandit algorithm is used to provide a series of suggestions by exploiting user's frequent past good behaviors, and seldom exploring non-frequent ones. Activity recognition to suggestion making happens inside the phone thus protecting user privacy. 2 week deployment of our software showed that users did more activity with adaptive suggestion compared to non-adaptive scheme. Qualitative interviewing reveled users finding adaptive suggestion more closer to their life's context than generic prescriptive counterpart.", "Rhythms guide our lives. Our biological clocks tell us when we need to sleep, eat and wake. But our use of technology can interrupt and obstruct these rhythms, making it difficult for our bodies to get what they need to stay healthy and balanced. MoodRhythm helps individuals to live a more naturally rhythmic day, ensuring that they can maintain balanced and healthy lives. The key goals of MoodRhythm is to use patients' smartphones to both actively and passively track daily rhythms and to provide affective feedback that can help patients to maintain a regular daily rhythm, while feeding this clinically valuable information back to their physicians.", "Recently in mobile and wearable computing, we have seen a rise in continuous sensing across different types of sensors and in device processing. Combination of these array of sensors and corresponding inference have capability to generate detailed non-trivial multidimensional information about the environment and the individual carrying the device. Also, there is a growing number of third-party applications that use these information for context-aware-computing, personal well-being, and just-in-time health care.", "Stress can have long term adverse effects on individuals\u2019 physical and mental well-being. Changes in the speech production process is one of many physiological changes that happen during stress. Microphones, embedded in mobile phones and carried ubiquitously by people, provide the opportunity to continuously and non-invasively monitor stress in real-life situations. We propose StressSense for unobtrusively recognizing stress from human voice using smartphones. We investigate methods for adapting a one-size-fitsall stress model to individual speakers and scenarios. We demonstrate that the StressSense classifier can robustly identify stress across multiple individuals in diverse acoustic environments: using model adaptation StressSense achieves 81% and 76% accuracy for indoor and outdoor environments, respectively. We show that StressSense can be implemented on commodity Android phones and run in real-time. To the best of our knowledge, StressSense represents the first system to consider voice based stress detection and model adaptation in diverse real-life conversational situations using smartphones.", "BeWell is the next generation in mobile health apps. The BeWell app continuously tracks user behaviors along three key health dimensions without requiring any user input. Classification algorithms run directly on the phone to automatically infer the user's sleep duration, physical activity, and social interaction. In addition to classifying activities that influence health, BeWell also computes a weighted score between 0 and 100 for each health dimension. A score of a 100 indicates that the user is matching or exceeding recommended guidelines (averaging eight hours sleep per day, for example). BeWell also promotes improved behavioral patterns via persuasive feedback as part of an animated aquatic ecosystem rendered as an ambient display on the smartphone's wallpaper screen.", "The study is aimed at comparing the effectiveness of paper-based survey tools with that of a passive electronic mobile sensing device (MSP) for the measurement of overall physical and social activity of eight senior citizens at Kendal Continuing Care Retirement Community. Before the start of the study, the Yale Physical Activity Survey, SF-36, Friendship Scale, and the CES-D were used to obtain a baseline understanding of subjects\u2019 physical, and social wellbeing. The study length was 15 consecutive days. Each subject was provided a charged, and activated device to wear at the waist during his/her waking hours and was instructed to continue performing their daily activities. Devices were collected at the end of the day for data extraction and charging. We are currently analyzing the results of the device and comparing them with the scores generated by the current paper-based surveys.", "The rising popularity of the sensor-equipped smartphone is changing the possible scale and scope of human activity inference. The diversity in user population seen in large user bases can overwhelm conventional one-size-fits-all classi\ufb01cation approaches. Although personalized models are better able to handle population diversity, they often require increased effort from the end user during training and are computationally expensive.", "Neural signals are everywhere just like mobile phones. We propose to use neural signals to control mobile phones for hands-free, silent and effortless human-mobile interaction. Until recently, devices for detecting neural signals have been costly, bulky and fragile. We present the design, implementation and evaluation of the NeuroPhone system, which allows neural signals to drive mobile phone applications on the iPhone using cheap off-the-shelf wireless electroencephalography (EEG) headsets. We demonstrate a brain-controlled address book dialing app, which works on similar principles to P300-speller brain-computer interfaces: the phone flashes a sequence of photos of contacts from the address book and a P300 brain potential is elicited when the flashed photo matches the person whom the user wishes to dial. EEG signals from the headset are transmitted wirelessly to an iPhone, which natively runs a lightweight classifier to discriminate P300 signals from noise. When a person\u2019s contact photo triggers a P300, his/her phone number is automatically dialed. NeuroPhone breaks new ground as a brain-mobile phone interface for ubiquitous pervasive computing. We discuss the challenges in making our initial prototype more practical, robust, and reliable as part of our on-going research.", "The People-Aware Computing group develops mobile sensing systems for capturing, learning, and interpreting people's context, activities and social networks.
