I've also done work and continue to think actively about\nsecurity, (fault tolerant) distriuted computing, and modal logic.\nMy work lies at the boundary of a number of fields. \nI once gave a talk in the economics department at Princeton where \nI described myself as someone with a Ph.D. in mathematics, who calls \nhimself a computer scientist, and is giving a talk to economists about\na subject mainly studied by philosophers.  \nThat's probably the best one-sentence description I can give.  \n\nIf you'd like more details,\ncheck my \n</p><ul>\n<li> list of <a name=\"tex2html10\" href=\"node8.html\">publications</a>.\n</li></ul>\nIt has pointers to abstracts of all my papers; in many cases, the paper itself is also available.
