I develop culturally embedded systems; i.e., new kinds of interactive technology that respond to and encourage critical reflection on the place of technology in culture.  Specifically, I analyze IT in the context of North American consumer culture and the rise of efficiency, productivity, and faith in technoscience as hegemonic cultural values. I use insights from cultural analysis of IT to identify and rethink the assumptions underlying technologies, to build new applications for computing, and to develop new techniques for designing and evaluating technologies.\nA major component of my current work is a long-term design-ethnographic and historical study of sociotechnological change in the small, traditional fishing community of <a href=\"http://www.changeislands.ca/\">Change Islands, Newfoundland</a>, looking at how changing sociotechnical infrastructures are tied with changing orientations to time, technology, and labor."]}
