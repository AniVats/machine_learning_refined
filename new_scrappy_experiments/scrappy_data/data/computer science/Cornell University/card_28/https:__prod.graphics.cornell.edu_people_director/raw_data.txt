During the past 30 years, he has been primarily concerned with research advancing the state-of-the-art in computer graphics and utilizing these techniques as they may be applied to a variety of disciplines. He has taught courses in computer graphics in Computer Science, computer-aided design in Architecture, computer animation in Art, and technology strategy in the Business School.\nHis current computer science research projects involve realistic image generation, parallel processing algorithms for rendering, new graphical user interfaces, and computer animation. His recent application research projects include ornithology and the search for the ivory-billed woodpecker, medical imaging and virtual surgery, architectural design for a green environment, and new types of computer displays from electronic paper to touch sensitive table displays. All of this research occurs at the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/\">Program of Computer Graphics</a>\u00a0at Cornell University.\nWorking with the General Electric Visual Simulation Laboratory, he produced a sophisticated computer graphics movie,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/online/cip/\">\"Cornell in Perspective\"</a>\u00a0as early as 1971. He is the author of hundreds of articles on computer graphics (including two published in Scientific American, May 1974 and February, 1991, both of which have been highly publicized); and he has lectured extensively on the uses of computer graphics techniques in research applications.\nHe served as the founding Director of the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.nsf.gov/\">National Science Foundation</a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.cs.brown.edu/stc/\">Science and Technology Center for Computer Graphics and Scientific Visualization</a>\u00a0until his term expired on July 1, 1995. This five-university consortium included Cornell and Brown Universities, the California Institute of Technology, the University of North Carolina, and the University of Utah. He was also the originator and former director of the Computer Aided Design Instructional Facility at Cornell University.\nDr. Greenberg joined the Faculty of Cornell in 1968 with a joint appointment in the Departments of Architecture and Structural Engineering. His prior education consisted of both the architecture and engineering disciplines at Cornell University and Columbia University. From 1960 to 1965, he served as a consulting engineer, and was involved with the design of numerous building projects including the St. Louis Arch, New York State Theater of the Dance at Lincoln Center, and Madison Square Garden.\nOf his hundreds of graduate students, many have gone on to become leaders in the fields of computer graphics, computer animation, and computer-aided design for architecture. In addition to many current faculty, eleven former students have won Hollywood's Technical \"Oscars,\" and five have won the prestigious Siggraph Achievement Award.\nIn June of 2005 Dr. Greenberg, '55, was honored during his 50th Reunion by the production of a film,\u00a0<a href=\"http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/handle/1813/3462\">\"True Big Red\"</a>\u00a0by Maddy and Phillip Handler, profiling his lifelong involvement with Cornell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</section>\n<section class=\"col-sm-3 col-sm-pull-9 sidebar\">\n<div class=\"region region-sidebar\">\n<nav class=\"links list-menu menu nav vertical mobile-expander menu--main\" id=\"block-mainnavigation-2\" role=\"navigation\">\n<h3 class=\"\"><a class=\"active-trail active\" href=\"/People\">People</a></h3>\n<ul class=\"menu menu-main\" region=\"sidebar\">\n<li class=\"leaf menu-main-item active_trail active\"> <a class=\"menu-main__link is-active\" data-drupal-link-system-path=\"node/18\" href=\"/people/director\">Director</a>\n\n</ul>\n</nav>\n\n</section>\n\n</main>\n<section class=\"container\" id=\"bottom-content\">\n</section>\n<footer>\n<div class=\"tint\">\n<div class=\"container\">\n<div class=\"footer row\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-4 footer-address\">\n<div class=\"region region-footer\">\n<div class=\"block block-block-content block-block-content7189739d-b809-4aa3-9f82-b9629ba9a3af\" id=\"block-contactus\">\n<div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item\">580 Rhodes Hall<br/>\nIthaca, NY 14853 USA<br/>\n+1.607.255.4880\n<a href=\"mailto:pcg-info@graphics.cornell.edu\">Contact Us</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col-sm-4 footer-logo\">\n<a href=\"http://cis.cornell.edu/\">\n<img alt=\"CIS\" src=\"/themes/custom/cs_pcg/images/cis_mark.png\"/>\n</a>\n\n<div class=\"col-sm-4 footer-logo footer-right\">\n<a href=\"http://tech.cornell.edu/\">\n<img alt=\"Cornell Tech\" src=\"/themes/custom/cs_pcg/images/cornell_tech_mark.png\"/>\n</a>\n\n\n<div class=\"subfooter row\">\n<div class=\"col-xs-12\">\n<div class=\"footer-divider\">\n\n<div class=\"col-sm-3\">\n<a href=\"http://www.cornell.edu/copyright.cfm\">Cornell University</a> \u00a92020\n                                    \n<div class=\"col-sm-6 footer-center\">\n                                            402 Gates Hall, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853 \n                                    \n<div class=\"col-sm-3 footer-right\">\n\n\n\n\n</footer>"]}
