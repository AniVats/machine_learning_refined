I have worked\n                on a variety of problems in early vision, including\n                motion and stereo; many of these problems can be solved\n                very accurately using algorithms based on graph cuts,\n                which was given the \n                (a small workshop for senior vision researchers), and\n                was a General Chair for My\n                medical work has focused on the problem of MR image\n                reconstruction, as well as on workflow issues. During 2016 and\n                2017 I was on leave at Google Research in NYC, where I now hold an appointment as a research scientist."]}
