The following <a href=\"https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/banerjee-ridesharing\">tutorial</a>, given as part of the Simons Institute Real-Time Decision Making Boot Camp, provides a introduction to this work (more details are available in an upcoming <a href=\"RidesharingChapter.pdf\">chapter</a>)."]}
