I acts as a \nliaison between these various departments.  I also teach the two core courses in game\ndesign and architecture.\n\n</p><hr width=\"50%\">\n\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3152\">CS/INFO 3152: Introduction to Game Design</a></h3>\n\n<p>\nThis is course is an introduction to the design and development of computer games from\na software-engineering perspective. It is open to all students at the sophomore and \njunior level, assuming that they have some minimum background in programming and/or design.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhile the course does cover classic game-development concepts like graphics, \nphysics, and AI, these are not the primary focus of the course. Many of these subsystems can \nbe delegated to third party libraries.  The challenge for students at this level is \nfiguring out how to come up with a game idea, and create a complex, integrated piece of \nsoftware implementing that idea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe course is structured as an agile development project with playable deliverables every \ntwo weeks.  I have developed several custom design documents and processes to help students \nthrough the development process.  One of the things I have noticed is that there is a \ndisconnect between how designers think about mechanics (as actions that take place over \nmultiple animation frames) and how programmers implement them (as actions and interactions\nlimited to a single animation frame).  A large part of the design vocabulary for this \nclass is bridging this gap.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe course website is available by clicking on the header above. Anyone is welcome to \nmake use of the lecture notes or labs. The example design documents, however, are \nrestricted to Cornell faculty and students.  This is because of restrictions on sharing \nstudent work.  For anyone interested in seeing sample design documents, I can make a \nfew examples available upon request.\n</p>\n\n<hr width=\"50%\">\n\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4152\">CS/INFO 4152: Advanced Topics in Game Design</a></h3>\n\n<p>\nThe advanced topics courses is intended to be a capstone experience for students later\nin their undergraduate career.  In addition to the introductory course CS/INFO 3152, \nstudents are expected to have taken a senior-level course related to game development, \nsuch as advanced graphics, AI, or networking. Students are expected to integrate those\nadvanced concepts into a game that is substantially more complex that the one developed \nin CS/INFO 3152.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe exact nature of the games in this course have varied over the years.  For many years\nthis course focused on 3D games, but the recent focus has been on mobile games.  I have\nfound that the constraints imposed by the mobile platform result in much more innovative\ngames.  Indeed, some of the games in this course have been featured at \n<a href=\"http://www.igf.com/php-bin/entry2014.php?id=7019\">independent game festivals</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis course is primarily discussion and critique, and so there are a lot less custom\nmaterials for this course.  However, there are lectures unique to the mobile platform,\nsuch as monetization or memory management. Again, these are available from the\nlink above.\n</p>\n\n<hr width=\"50%\">\n\n<h3>CS/INFO 4999: Independent Study</h3>\n\n<p>\nEvery semester I accept students for independent study through a competitive process.\nStudents interested in developing a game for an independent study must first have\ntaken CS/INFO 3152.  The students must submit a concept document and initial gameplay \nspecification following the format for that course. The best design documents for that \nsemester are chosen for independent study.  Some these projects are available to view\nat the <a href=\"http://gdiac.cis.cornell.edu/\">GDIAC webpage</a>.\n</p>\n\n<hr width=\"50%\">\n\n<h3>Career Advising</h3>\n\n<p>\nAs director of GDIAC, I am often the point of contact for the various game design studios\nthat recruit from Cornell.  Cornell has a good record of placement at major game \nstudios such as Electronic Arts, Valve, Bungie, Zenimax, and the like.  We also\nhave several students who have chosen to create their own start-ups, particularly\nin the mobile space.\n</p>\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">\n\n<a name=\"other\"></a>\n<h2>Other Teaching Interests</h2>\n\n<p>\nIn addition to the game design courses, I have several other interests in education,\nboth within and outside Cornell.\n</p>\n\n<hr width=\"50%\">\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1110\">CS 1110: Introduction to Computing in Python</a></h3>\n\n<p>\nIn the semesters that I am not teaching the game design courses, I teach the introductory\nCS course at Cornell.  I was responsible for moving this course from Java to Python. This\nmove was very successful, in that it lowered the barrier of entry for students who had\nnever programmed before.  Through the use of <a href=\"http://kivy.org\">Kivy</a>, we were \nable to retain a lot of the graphics-centric assignments from our Java course, but \nsimplify them tremendously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAssignments and course materials are available from the link above.  Solutions are available \nto instructors upon request.\n</p>\n\n<hr width=\"50%\">\n\n<h3>Inquiry-Based Learning</h3>\n\n<p align=\"left\">\nBefore coming to Cornell, I was an assistant professor of mathematics and computer \nscience at the <a href=\"http://www.udallas.edu\">University of Dallas</a>.  During my\ntime there I developed extensive experience in \n<a href=\"http://www.thirteen.org/edonline/concept2class/inquiry/index.html\">inquiry-based \nlearning in mathematics</a>, sometimes known as the \n<a href=\"http://www.discovery.utexas.edu/rlm/reference/mahavier1.html\">Moore Method</a>.\nI have several theorem sequences (available on request) suitable for \n\"bridge courses\", which introduce students to the concept of proof.  One is designed\nfor mathematics majors, while another, on synthetic geometry, is geared towards\nhumanities majors.  \n</p>\n\n<p>\nI apply a lot of these techniques in my game design courses, particularly in the more\ndiscussion-based CS/INFO 4152. Before taking over the game design curriculum at Cornell,\nI applied these techniques to computer science in my course \n<a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Courses/cs305/2006fa/\">CS 305: Problem Solving in Computer Science</a>.\n</p>\n\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">\n\n<a name=\"research\"></a>\n<h2>Research Interests</h2>\n\n<p align=\"left\">\nI am a mathematical logician by training.  My original thesis work was in\ncomputable model theory.  From this work I moved onto the design of high-level\nlanguages for databases and information systems.  More recently, I have combined\nmy professional research in databases and query languages with my hobbies in\ngaming and game design.\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">\nThe following is an overview of my most recent research projects.\n</p>\n\n<hr width=\"50%\">\n\n<h3>Data-Driven Games</h3>\n\n<p align=\"left\">\nComputer games are becoming increasingly <i>data-driven</i>, meaning that the\nthe game content is separated from the game code.  Just as database queries\nretrieve data declaratively, game designers want to specify the behavior of \nnonplayer characters (NPCs) through rules and specifications.  However, as\nwith databases, the expressiveness of this behavior comes at the price of \nperformance.  In the Cornell <a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/database/games/\">data-driven\ngames project</a>, we are developing a language framework that allows designers\nto specify complex character behavior, without worrying about how to implement \nit efficiently [WDKGR07].\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li style=\"margin-top:5pt\">\n  [ZWSBDGW11] \n  T.

It is intended to bridge the \nperformance gap between general data stream management systems, such as \n<a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/stream/\">STREAM</a>, and \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish/subscribe\">publish/subscribe</a> \nsystems.  The goal is to find a sweet spot where we can achieve both\nexpressiveness and scalable implementation. My interest in this project has \nbeen in the design of a novel query languages with formal semantics [DGHRW06,DGPRSW07].\nThe design of this query language has lead to several interesting theoretical\nquestions on the nature of time stamps in streams [WRGD06-TR].\n\n</p><ul>\n  <li style=\"margin-top:5pt\">\n  [DGHKRW07] \n  A.
