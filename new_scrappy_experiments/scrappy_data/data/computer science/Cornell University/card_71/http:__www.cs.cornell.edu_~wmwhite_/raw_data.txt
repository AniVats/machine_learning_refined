It is open to all students at the sophomore and \njunior level, assuming that they have some minimum background in programming and/or design.\n", "\nIn addition to the game design courses, I have several other interests in education,\nboth within and outside Cornell.\n", "\nI am a mathematical logician by training.  My original thesis work was in\ncomputable model theory.  From this work I moved onto the design of high-level\nlanguages for databases and information systems.  More recently, I have combined\nmy professional research in databases and query languages with my hobbies in\ngaming and game design.\n", "\nThe following is an overview of my most recent research projects.\n"]}
