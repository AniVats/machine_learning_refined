I was also Chair of\u00a0the Computing Research Board in the late 1980s, spearheading its morph into the CRA (Computing Research Association) ---opening an\u00a0office in Washington and beginning to actively represent the research and education interests of CS there.\n    My main research interests over the years have been in compiler writing, programming methodology, teaching programming, and related\u00a0subjects. Bringing research advances in programming methodology to the undergrad level has been a particular pursuit of mine, and I am proud to have been among the first ten Weiss Presidential Fellows at Cornell."]}
