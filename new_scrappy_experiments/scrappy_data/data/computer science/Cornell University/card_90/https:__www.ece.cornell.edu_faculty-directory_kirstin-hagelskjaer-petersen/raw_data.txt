Their evolutionary success stems from more than just intelligent individuals, it hinges on their morphology, their physical interactions, and the way they shape and leverage their environment. Petersen's\u00a0research explores how the same principles can be leveraged\u00a0to achieve advanced autonomy in robot collectives, through hardware and software co-development, and by integrating the shared environment into the design process. Current\u00a0research themes span collective robotic construction, human swarm interaction,\u00a0soft robot collectives, biological swarms, and bio-hybrid collectives.Kirstin did her postdoctoral work with Director Sitti at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems 2014-2016 and became a fellow with the Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems in 2015. Her thesis was completed in 2014 with Professor Nagpal at Harvard University and the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering.\u202fShe completed a masters in Computer Systems Engineering with Professor Hallam at the University of Southern Denmark in\u00a02008, and a bachelor in electro-technical engineering with Odense University College of Engineering in\u00a02005.\u00a0</section><section aria-labelledby=\"nf-b-1590\" class=\"section--faculty-detail faculty-detail__biography\"><h2 id=\"nf-b-1590\">Research Interests</h2><ul><a href=\"/robotics\" hreflang=\"en\">Robotics</a><a href=\"/artificial-intelligence\" hreflang=\"en\">Artificial Intelligence</a><a href=\"/sensors-and-actuators\" hreflang=\"en\">Sensors and Actuators</a><a href=\"/rapid-prototyping\" hreflang=\"en\">Rapid Prototyping</a><a href=\"/computer-architecture\" hreflang=\"en\">Computer Architecture</a><a href=\"/computer-engineering\" hreflang=\"en\">Computer Engineering</a></ul><a class=\"btn\" href=\"#research_group_members\">Research Group Members</a></section><section aria-labelledby=\"nf-e-1590\" class=\"section--faculty-detail faculty-detail__publications\">"]}
