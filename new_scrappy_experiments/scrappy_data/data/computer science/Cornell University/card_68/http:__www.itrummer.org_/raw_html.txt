By measuring evaluation progress\n        per time unit and optimally balancing exploration and expoitation in\n        plan selections, we guarantee near-optimal expected execution cost\n        for queries on large data.  \n        See <a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/database/learning.php\">here</a> for more details, talks, and source code.\n        </dd><dt>CiceroDB</dt>\n        <dd>\n        We are working on several research projects around voice-based data access. \n        Those projects fall into three broad categories: research on how to interpret\n        user speech input more reliably, research on optimally summarizing trends in\n        query results via voice output (\"data vocalization\"), and research on \n        specializing query processing to voice interfaces (e.g., by interleaving\n        system speaking time with processing time). Research outcomes are integrated\n        into CiceroDB, a novel DBMS designed from the ground up for voice-based data access.\n        See <a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/database/vocalization.php\">here</a>\n        for more details, talks, and publications.\n        </dd>\n        <dt>AggChecker</dt>\n        <dd>\n        Data are often summarized via text documents, examples include newspaper articles\n        by data journalists, business reports, or scientific papers. Mistakes in data\n        summaries often go by unnoticed as there is no time to verify each claim.\n        In collaboration with Google NYC, we created a system, similar to a spell checker, \n        that verifies consistency between natural language claims and relational data sets.\n        See <a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/database/checking.php\">here</a> for a live\n        demo, talks, and publications.\n        </dd>\n        <dt>Optimizer Testing</dt>\n        <dd>\n        This line of work is targeted at supporting developers of query optimizers.\n        To assess the quality of query optimizers (and to identify candidate areas\n        for improvements), it is useful to compare plans produced by an optimizer\n        to guaranteed optimal plans. Guaranteed optimal plans are difficult to find\n        since we cannot rely on the optimizer cost or cardinality model. We are developing\n        approaches to find guaranteed optimal plans via offline optimization. \n        This requires executing plans or plan fragments to obtain\n        guaranteed bounds on execution costs and intermediate result sizes.\n        See <a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/database/testing.php\">here</a> for more details, talks, and publications. \n        </dd>\n        </dl>\n        This list does not include several projects (in the areas of deterministic\n        approximation and automated fact checking) that we started recently.\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"students\">\n        <h1>PhD Students</h1>\n        <p>I am currently working with the following PhD students:</p>\n        <ul>\n        \t<li><b>Saehan Jo</b></li>\n        \t<li><b>George Karagiannis</b></li>\n        \t<li><b>Junxiong Wang</b></li>\n        \t<li><b>Ziyun Wei</b></li>\n        </ul>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"teaching\">\n        <h1>Teaching</h1>\n        <p>I am regularly teaching the following courses at Cornell:</p>\n        <ul>\n        \t<li><b>CS 4320</b>: Introduction to Database Systems</li>\n        \t<li><b>CS 4321</b>: Practicum in Database Systems</li>\n        \t<li><b>CS 6320</b>: Advanced Database Systems</li>\n        \t<li><b>CS 7390</b>: Seminar in Database Systems</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>More details about those courses can be found \n        <a href=\"http://localhost/dbgrouphp/teaching.php\">here</a>.\n        </p></div>\n        <div id=\"service\">\n        <h1>Service</h1>\n        <p>I serve(d) in the following capacities:</p>\n        <ul>\n        <li>Since recently, I serve as associate editor for SIGMOD Record</li>\n        <li>I serve(d) as reviewer for SIGMOD 2018, 2019, and 2020</li>\n        <li>I serve(d) as reviewer for VLDB 2018, 2019, and 2020</li>\n        </ul>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"publications\">\n        <h1>Publications</h1>\n          <h2>2020</h2>\n  <ul>\n  \t<li><b>VLDB 2020</b> Mining an \u201cAnti-Knowledge Base\u201d from Wikipedia updates\nwith applications to fact checking and beyond.
