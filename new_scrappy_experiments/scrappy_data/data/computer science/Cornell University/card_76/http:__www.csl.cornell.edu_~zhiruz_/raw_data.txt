{"email": [], "image": ["imgs/zhang.jpg", "http://c.statcounter.com/6633168/0/92b0afa0/1/"], "research_blurb": ["\n  I am an Associate Professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University and a member of the Computer Systems Laboratory. My research investigates new algorithms, methodologies, and tools to extend the frontiers of design automation for high-performance and energy-efficient computer systems. More concretely, my recent publications focus on the topics of high-level synthesis, architecture and compiler optimization for hardware specialization, and software-defined reconfigurable systems. My research has been recognized with a Google Faculty Research Award (2018), the DAC Under-40 Innovators Award (2018), the Rising Professional Achievement Award from the UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science (2018), a DARPA Young Faculty Award (2015), the IEEE CEDA Ernest S. Kuh Early Career Award (2015), an NSF CAREER Award (2015), the Ross Freeman Award for Technical Innovation from Xilinx (2012), a Best Paper Award from FPGA (2019), a Best Short Paper Award from FCCM (2018), a Best Paper Award from the ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems (2012), and three best paper nominations (ICCAD'2009, FPGA'2017, FPGA'2018). On the teaching side, I received the Ruth and Joel Spira Award for Excellence in Teaching (2018) and the Michael Tien'72 Excellence in Teaching Award from College of Engineering (2016).\n  Prior to joining Cornell, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Upon graduation, I co-founded AutoESL Design Technologies, Inc. based on of my dissertation research at UCLA on high-level synthesis. AutoESL was acquired by Xilinx in 2011 and its high-level synthesis tool is now known as Vivado HLS; from 2011 to 2012, I served as a software development manager at Xilinx. I have a B.S. in Computer Science from Peking University, and an M.S. in Computer Science from UCLA.\n"]}
