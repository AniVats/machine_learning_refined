These fields integrate \n        methods from many disciplines, so that the work ranges from technical \n        topics, such as distributed computing and information representation, \n        to the economic and social aspects of change. My book Digital Libraries \n        was published by the MIT Press in winter 2000. This year we received a \n        major grant to integrate many separate projects into the NSF's new digital \n        library for science, mathematics, engineering and technology education. \n        This is likely to be the largest and most heterogeneous digital library \n        yet attempted. Cornell's multidisciplinary team combines computer science, \n        librarian and user interfaces design expertise. One of my principal interests \n        is the change in scientific publication as online materials replace printed \n        journals as the primary means of creating, storing, and distributing research \n        information. I have recently completed a period as chair of the ACM Publications \n        Board, am a member of the MIT Press Management Board, and am a member \n        of a strategic planning committee of the American Physical Society.

The group, now having made some \n        significant advances in answering questions that had remained unsolved \n        for over 30 years, is now in the process of trying to obtain reliable \n        mathematical models. This involves building computer simulations of dynamic \n        packing results under constrained perturbations and deformations. The \n        other project is in understanding deformations of trans membrane proteins \n        used in cell-signaling processes. This is a carefully constrained version \n        of the protein-folding problems that have been exciting the mathematical \n        biology community in recent years; the application of a topological viewpoint \n        in collaborating with molecular pharmacologists and structural biologists \n        has already yielded some intriguing insights. <br>\n        <br>\n        <b>Honors/Awards</b> <br>\n        Kenneth A.

This work has three broad themes. Our \n        main focus is on a new system called \"Spinglass\" (<a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/Spinglass\">http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/Spinglass</a> \n        ). The idea is to explore a class of reliable multicast protocols that \n        are extremely scalable and provide unusually stable throughput under stress. \n        We believe that stable throughput is a common requirement in demanding \n        critical settings, but few reliable protocols have this property. By scalability, \n        we mean that a system which works with ten computers should also be usable \n        with ten thousand of them. Spinglass involves two subprojects. One, called \n        Astrolabe, is concerned with a new way to represent data in a network. \n        Astrolabe is like a network-wide database in which each computer or component \n        contributes a live tuple. As data change, Astrolabe propagates the updates. \n        The system uses a form of dynamically materialized view to continuously \n        compute summaries of th epicture of the network as a whole. This results \n        in a powerful new tool for distributed monitoring, management, control, \n        and live collaboration. Robbert van Renesse is the leader on this work, \n        and we're collaborating with Al Demers and Johannes Gehrke on aspects \n        related to databases and data mining. The second big part of Spinglass \n        is concerned with reliable multicast. We've developed a scalable multicast \n        protocol that gives probabilistic consistency guarantees, and we are finding \n        ways to apply this in practical settings. Graduate students looking at \n        these questions include Indranil Gupta, who is developing algorithms that \n        make direct use of probabilistic guarantees; Rimon Barr, who is looking \n        at adapting these tools for mobile networks; and Ranveer Chandra and Venugopalen \n        Ramasubramanian, who areinvestigating ad-hoc mobile networking. Kate Jenkins \n        and Ken Hopkinson are looking at applications that arise when using these \n        protocols in real-world settings arising from the restructuring of the \n        electric power grid.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our third big activity is joint work with \n        Bob Constable's Nuprl project, and involves the use of formal methods \n        to prove properties of reliable communication protocols, such as those \n        used in Isis, Horus, and Ensemble. <br>\n        Our project is funded primarily by DARPA, with some additional funding \n        from the Electric Power Research Institute and Microsoft Research. The \n        project is directed by myself, R. van Renesse, and W. Vogels. R. Bhoedjang \n        is visiting as a post-doc for a few years, and developing Intrusion Detection \n        software to make use of Astrolabe.<br>\n        <br>\n        <b>Honors</b><br>\n        Stephen '57 and Marilyn Miles Excellence in Teaching Award, 2000.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>University Activities</b><br>\n        Committees: Founding Committee for Faculty of Computing and Information \n        Science; University Conflicts of Interest; Chairman of the Responsible \n        Conduct of Research Committee, Engineering College Policy Committee; IP \n        Advisory Council for the Cornell Research Foundation. <br>\n        <br>\n        <b>Lectures</b><br>\n        Next Generation Internet: Unsafe at any Speed?<br>\n        -.

To speed up program execution, \n        the CPU needs to process useful instructions while waiting for the memory. \n        One way of providing a processor with useful work is to predict what it \n        will have to do next. Many commodity microprocessors already contain branch \n        predictors to boost their performance, and it is likely that more predictors \n        will be needed to meet the continuing demand for ever-faster CPUs.

Our work encompasses \n        three related areas: (1) machine learning of natural language, (2) the \n        use of corpus-based NLP techniques to aid information retrieval (IR) and \n        summarization systems, and (3) the design of user-trainable NLP systems \n        that can efficiently and reliably extract the important information from \n        a document.<br>\n        In the past year or so we have made progress on both the natural language \n        processing and machine learning aspects of our research. First, we have \n        extended our approach to partial parsing of natural language texts to \n        operate effectively in a weakly supervised learning framework. The original \n        approach, developed with graduate students Scott Mardis and David Pierce, \n        combines corpus-based grammar induction with a very simple pattern-matching \n        algorithm and an optional constituent verification step. In evaluations \n        on a number of large-scale partial parsing tasks involving on-line text, \n        the approach produces partial parsers that are both fast and accurate. \n        <br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, however, large amounts of expensive, \n        human-annotated data are required for training. In new work with David \n        Pierce, we investigate the use of weakly supervised learning algorithms \n        for partial parsing that require only a small set of labeled training \n        instances. In particular, we examine the learning behavior of co-training, \n        a weakly supervised learning paradigm in which the redundancy of the learning \n        task is captured by training two classifiers using separate views of the \n        same data. This enables bootstrapping from a small set of labeled training \n        data via a large set of unlabeled data. For noun phrase bracketing, we \n        find that co-training reduces by 36 percent the difference in error between \n        co-trained classifiers and fully supervised classifiers trained on a labeled \n        version of all available data. However, degradation in the quality of \n        the bootstrapped data arises as an obstacle to further improvement. To \n        address this, we propose a moderately supervised variant of co-training \n        in which a human corrects the mistakes made during automatic labeling. \n        Our analysis suggests that corrected co-training and similar moderately \n        supervised methods may help co-training scale to other natural language \n        learning tasks that typically require large amounts of training data.<br>\n        In a joint project with CoGenTex Inc. and the University of Montreal, \n        we have begun to extend existing corpus-based learning algorithms for \n        information extraction to acquire a broader set of extraction patterns. \n        We have implemented a new learning algorithm, Autoslog-XML, that can extract \n        linguistic entities beyond just noun phrases. Autoslog-XML is a semi-supervised \n        algorithm for locating useful extraction patterns from unrestricted text. \n        The learned extraction patterns have been employed to support domain-specific \n        multi-document summarization in the natural disasters domain. We have \n        also begun to investigate the application of the extraction pattern learning \n        algorithm for Korean texts. Graduate students Vincent Ng and Kiri Wagstaff \n        are part of this joint research effort.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The techniques described above can, in turn, be \n        used to support a number of practical, end-to-end text-processing tasks \n        in addition to multi-document summarization. For example, we are using \n        the corpus-based partial-parsing techniques as the primary linguistic \n        component in a new system for general-knowledge question answering. The \n        system combines techniques for standard information retrieval, query-dependent \n        text summarization, and shallow syntactic and semantic sentence analysis. \n        In a series of experiments, we examined the role of each statistical and \n        linguistic knowledge source in the question-answering system and find \n        that even very weak linguistic knowledge can offer substantial improvements \n        over purely IR-based techniques for question answering, especially when \n        smoothly integrated with statistical preferences computed by the IR subsystems.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in machine learning research with Kiri \n        Wagstaff, we are investigating the use of prior knowledge in the form \n        of user-supplied constraints to improve the performance of clustering \n        algorithms.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>University Activities</b><br>\n        College Scholar Advisor.<br>\n        College Scholar Committee Chair.<br>\n        Independent Major Advisor.<br>\n        Cognitive Studies Concentration Advisor.<br>\n        Member: Faculty of Computing and Information Founders; Faculty of Computing \n        and Information Working Group for Information Science; Faculty of Computing \n        and Information Working Group for Crosscutting Education Programs; Independent \n        Major Advisory Board; Provost's Advisory Group of Women in Science and \n        Engineering; Cognitive Studies Steering Committee; Computer Science Department \n        Ph.D. admissions committee; Department of Computer Science space committee; \n        Cognitive Studies Selection Committees for Summer Fellowships, for Continuing \n        Fellowships, and for Incoming Fellowships.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Professional Activities</b><br>\n        Secretary: North American Association for Computational Linguistics (2000-2001).<br>\n        Secretary: SIGNLL, Association for Computational Linguistics special interest \n        group on Natural Language<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learning (1999-2001).<br>\n        Editorial Board: Machine Learning (1999-2001), Semantic Web Journal.<br>\n        Action Editor: Journal of Machine Learning Research (2000-2002).<br>\n        Program co-chair: Fourth Computational Natural Language Learning Workshop \n        (CoNLL 2000).<br>\n        Member: DARPA/NSF Question and Answering Roadmap Committee; DARPA/NSF \n        Summarization Roadmap<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Committee; DARPA Translingual Information Detection, \n        Extraction, and Summarization (TIDES) Evaluation Committee.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Program Committees</b><br>\n        Eighteenth International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) (2001).<br>\n        Seventeenth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence \n        (IJCAI) (2001).<br>\n        First International Conference on Knowledge Capture (K-CAP) (2001).<br>\n        39th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2001).<br>\n        Second Meeting of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational \n        Linguistics (2001).<br>\n        Fifth Computational Natural Language Learning Workshop (CoNLL) (2001).<br>\n        Area Chair: The 24th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research \n        and Development in Information<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Retrieval (2001).<br>\n        Reviewer: Special issue of Computational Linguistics on anaphora resolution.<br>\n        Executive Board: SIGDAT, Special Interest Group of ACL for Linguistic \n        Data and Corpus-based approaches to<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NLP. <br>\n        NSF Review Panel: Knowledge and Cognitive Systems (2000); Human-Computer \n        Interaction (2001).</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Lectures</b><br>\n        Noun Phrase Co-reference for Information Extraction.

These practical applications have included placement, motion \n        planning, shape comparison, vision, sensing, mesh generation, molecular \n        matching, and protein shape-comparison.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent work on protein shape, Klara Kedem and \n        I have developed a new kind of \"consensus shape\" for protein \n        families. This is an analog of the consensus string that is sometimes \n        used for multiple alignment of proteins. The idea is based, in part, on \n        our previous work on the Unit-vector Root Mean Square (URMS) distance \n        for protein shapes. The consensus shape is a pseudo-protein with useful \n        properties. It is a pseudo-protein because it fails to have certain characteristics \n        of real proteins. In particular, for the consensus shape, the spacing \n        between successive alpha carbons is variable, with small distances in \n        regions where the members of the protein family exhibit significant variation \n        and large distances (up to the standard spacing of four angstroms) in \n        regions where the family members agree. Despite this nonprotein-like characteristic, \n        the consensus shape does preserve structural information. If all members \n        of a protein family exhibit a geometric relationship between corresponding \n        alpha carbons then that relationship is preserved in the consensus shape. \n        In particular, distances and angles that are consistent across family \n        members are preserved. Thus, the consensus shape provides a compact summary \n        of the significant strucutural information for a family. We are exploring \n        the use of the consensus shape (1) as a tool for improved protein threading \n        for use in protein structure prediction and (2) as a tool for automating \n        the division of proteins into families and subfamilies.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My work on mesh generation has been motivated \n        by the finite element method for finding approximate solutions to partial \n        differential equations. The first step of this method is to create a mesh, \n        i.e. to divide the given problem region into simple shapes called elements \n        (usually triangles or quadrilaterals in 2D, tetrahedra or hexahedra in \n        3D). A number of algorithms have been developed to automate this process, \n        but most of them don't guarantee the quality of the resulting mesh (e.g., \n        a triangle may cross a region boundary or there may be some flat triangles, \n        leading to poor error bounds). I developed efficient techniques for producing \n        meshes of guaranteed quality for problems in the plane and for curved \n        surfaces. The triangles produced are close to equilateral in shape; all \n        region boundaries are respected; and the user can control the element \n        density, producing small elements in \"interesting\" regions and \n        large elements elsewhere.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I extended this work to produce tetrahedral meshes \n        for three-dimensional problems. The major difficulty here is to avoid \n        producing \"slivers\": tetrahedra with nicely shaped faces but \n        with near-zero volume. I showed that slivers can be avoided by choosing \n        each new mesh point randomly within a small specified volume. The randomness \n        helps; a good mesh point-one that does not form any slivers-can be found \n        in constant expected time.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This work is being used in a large, multi-disciplinary \n        project: developing adaptive software for field-driven simulations. In \n        particular, we focus on computational fracture mechanics and reactive, \n        multiphase fluid flows. Our goal is to develop principles for building \n        software systems that can adapt to changing conditions. These conditions \n        include changes in the desired physics (e.g. we may need to change our \n        physics model when we discover that vibration is significant), changes \n        in the desired algorithms (e.g. we may change our solution technique depending \n        on how quickly we are converging toward a solution), and changes in the \n        computing environment (e.g. additional processors may become available \n        or we may lose processors due to processor failure).

It provides substantial automation in the design, coding, verification, \n        and evolution of large software systems. Generally an LPE will integrate \n        programming languages and logics. In our case we integrate the ML programming \n        language and a programming logic based on type theory. Reasoning about \n        ML programs is founded on type theoretic semantics for ML. The LPE also \n        integrates a compiler and a theorem prover. We use the latest version \n        of Nuprl as the prover.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past year we have deployed our prototype \n        LPE to support the Ensemble group communication system that Ken Birman, \n        Robbert van Renesse, and their students have built. The LPE provides automatic \n        code transformations that improve performance in a way that is guaranteed \n        not to introduce errors. The LPE also supports the design and coding of \n        new adaptive protocols that are part of the Spinglass project.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nuprl 5 system is a major re-implementation \n        of Nuprl 4; its design is based on communicating processes that synchronize \n        around a logical database that we call \"the Library.\" The Library \n        stores definitions, theorems, conjectures, proofs, algorithms, proof tactics, \n        and commentary that is linked to the formal mathematics. We released the \n        first version of Nuprl 5 last summer, with a debut at CADE in June involving \n        the whole design and implementation team (Stuart Allen, Rich Eaton, Christoph \n        Kreitz, Lori Lorigo, and me). Nuprl 5 supports multiple proof engines \n        and multiple editors. It also integrates an automatic theorem prover, \n        called the JProver, built by C. Kreitz, Jens Otten, and Stephan Schmitt.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Library includes over ten thousand theorems. \n        Many of these are used in system verification, but a large number are \n        from general mathematics. These general theorems are a valuable resource. \n        We are funded by ONR to further develop and explore the concept of a formal \n        digital library of formal constructive mathematics built around these \n        theorems. We will generalize our mechanisms to allow many users to contribute \n        to the Library using other theorem provers such as ACL2, HOL and PVS. \n        <br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also working on a more experimental LPE \n        called MetaPRL, which started with Jason Hickey's thesis and now involves \n        many people but especially Aleksey Nogin and Alexsey Kopylov. This system \n        is built entirely in OCaml and supports OCaml as its programming language. \n        It is coded for efficiency as well as modularity, and at some tasks it \n        is over two orders of magnitude faster than Nuprl 5. It also supports \n        multiple programming logics. Nuprl 5 and MetaPRL share mathematics libraries.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two theorem provers are used in a variety \n        of other projects as well, including the creation of formal courseware \n        by S. Allen, the translation of formal proofs into natural language by \n        Amanda Holland-Minkley, the automatic analysis of the computational complexity \n        of higher-order programs by Ralph Benzinger, and efficient reflection \n        being designed and implemented by Eli Barzilay. We follow the work of \n        Greg Morrisett and his students on new ML compilers and on typed assembly \n        language. We plan to use the LPE to broadly support research on language-based \n        security in the department and at the new Information Assurance Institute, \n        including the work of Dexter Kozen, Andrew Myers, and Fred Schneider.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>University Activities</b><br>\n        Dean: Computing and Information Science. <br>\n        Committees: Applied Math Policy; Cognitive Studies Executive Committee; \n        Theory Center Executive Committee.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Professional Activities</b><br>\n        Advisory Council: Princeton University Department of Computer Science. \n        <br>\n        Editor: <i>Journal of Logic and Computation</i>; <i>Formal Methods in \n        System Design</i>; <i>Journal of Symbolic <br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computation</i>. <br>\n        Director: NATO Summer School, Marktoberdorf, Germany. <br>\n        General Committee Member: LICS. </font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Lectures</b><br>\n        How Computers Think.

With Ken Birman, Robbert van Renesse, \n        Johannes Gehrke, and others, I am studying randomized \"gossip protocols.\" \n        Such protocols are highly fault-tolerant and, when properly designed, \n        extremely scalable as well. We are studying convergence properties of \n        several flat and hierarchal versions of the basic protocols tailored to \n        specific application requirements.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My particular focus is approximate evaluation \n        of aggregate queries in such a system. We are studying age distributions \n        of gossiped data in order to prove probabilistic bounds on the quality \n        of aggregate query results. Alternatively, we can use this approach to \n        bound the latency required to probabilistically guarantee a client-specified \n        degree of consistency.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are considering classes of \"resource location\" \n        or \"anomaly detection\" problems, in which query results are \n        site-specific and depend on distance and subsumption. Such problems can \n        have efficient and highly scalable solutions using gossip partner choice \n        distributions based on the distance between sites.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we are studying graph constructions for \n        which flooding or deterministic gossip partner choices can be used, leading \n        to reduced overhead while still retaining most of the desirable properties \n        of randomized gossip.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above is related to my previous work on the \n        Clearinghouse and Bayou projects at Xerox PARC. I am also doing work supported \n        by Oracle on asynchronous update-anywhere replication in a more traditional \n        database setting.

We develop \n        computer algorithms to study sequences, structures, dynamics, and function \n        of proteins and apply these methods to a variety of biological problems. \n        Our techniques are implemented in the systems MOIL and LOOPP, available \n        on the web <a href=\"http://www.tc.cornell.edu/CBIO\">http://www.tc.cornell.edu/CBIO</a>.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My current research directions include: mean field \n        approaches for global optimization and structure prediction (Locally Enhanced \n        Sampling). Structures are often determined by an optimization of an energy \n        function. I introduced mean field approaches that modify the target function \n        and make it more accessible to global optimization. We have applied these \n        techniques to determine conformations of short peptides and to refine \n        low-resolution structures of proteins. These approaches are implemented \n        into MOIL. <br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also working on development of folding \n        potentials using linear programming. An ideal folding potential assigns \n        the lowest energy to the correct three-dimensional structure of a protein. \n        All other structures must have higher energies. The design of folding \n        potentials relies on considerable human intuition and many trials and \n        errors. I developed an automated protocol that \"learns\" and \n        improves the quality of the current potential energy. We used this protocol \n        to prove that the widely used pairwise interactionmodel cannot recognize \n        exactly correct protein folds. Based on these studies, a novel threading \n        algorithm was designed and implemented in the program LOOPP. In a threading \n        algorithm a sequence is matched with a structure. In a recent article \n        in Science, we published an intriguing application of this program. We \n        suggested an evolutionary link between a gene that controls the size of \n        the tomato fruit and a protein that participates in controlling cell growth \n        and division. Malfunction of this protein causes cancer in humans (joint \n        work with Steve Tanksley's group).<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another project concerns extending the time scale \n        of simulations. One of the striking observations in dynamics of biological \n        molecules is the extremely large time scale they covered. Initiation by \n        light absorption of biochemical processes is very rapid (femtoseconds), \n        while protein folding is slow (milliseconds to minutes). Current simulation \n        approaches (Molecular Dynamics (MD)) are restricted to nanoseconds (10-9 \n        seconds). I developed a stochastic path integral formulation that provides \n        a numerically stable trajectory for almost any arbitrary time step. We \n        apply the new algorithm to study activation of proteins (the R-&gt;T transitions \n        in hemoglobin, microseconds) and to protein folding (folding of C peptide, \n        tens of nanoseconds). The method provides systematic approximations to \n        the dynamics and is more efficient than MD by orders of magnitude. It \n        is available in MOIL.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Professional Activities</b><br>\n        Acting head: NIH resource for parallel computing at the Cornell Theory \n        Center.<br>\n        Committees: Statistical and Computational Genomics Committee; Computational \n        Biology Committee for the collaborative efforts at Cornell, Rockefeller, \n        and Sloan Kettering Institutes; Cornell Life Science Advisory Board;<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Planning Committee for Life Science and Technology \n        Building; Theory Center committee. <br>\n        National Committees: NIH study sections; NSF study section; Reviewer for \n        the State of Texas; Chair: <br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; workshop on protein dynamics, Telluride (August, \n        2001). </font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Lectures</b><br>\n        Protein Recognition by Threading.

My group is currently involved in three projects: \n        The <a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/database/Himalaya/index.htm\">Himalaya \n        Data Mining Project</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/database/cougar/\">Cougar \n        Sensor Database System</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/database/amazon/\">Amazon \n        Stream Processing Project</a>.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Himalaya Data Mining Project we develop \n        new data mining functionality, and we work on techniques to make the resulting \n        data mining models more understandable to the user. As an example, consider \n        classification trees, a data mining model that is supported in nearly \n        all commercial data mining suites. In recent research we have shown that \n        a large class of classification tree construction algorithms is biased \n        (including most algorithms used in commercial tools), thus, users could \n        draw incorrect conclusions from the resulting \"incorrect\" classification \n        tree. Our methods can provably eliminate this bias from any existing split \n        selection method. Other recent results include the fastest published algorithm \n        for mining long market baskets, and new methods for mining long sequential \n        patterns.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The widespread deployment of sensors and \n        mobile devices is transforming our physical environment into a computing \n        platform. There is now computing power on every device, and emerging networking \n        techniques ensure that devices are interconnected and accessible from \n        local or wide-area networks. This is a distributed database system of \n        unprecedented scale. In the Cougar Sensor DatabaseSystem, we develop database \n        technology for tasking, mining, and monitoring such a large number of \n        distributed data sources. We have implemented the first generation of \n        the Cougar Device Database System, where we leverage the processing power \n        on the devices to push query processing directly to the data sources. \n        Different query processing strategies allow us to balance resource usage, \n        accuracy, and speed of query answers. Our current research focuses on \n        distributed and fault tolerant query processing and meta-data management.<br>\n        In many applications, for example in intrusion detection, sensor networks, \n        and network management, data arrive in streams, and the large volume of \n        such high-speed data streams makes storage and offline processing of the \n        data infeasible. In the Amazon Stream Processing Project, we are developing \n        query processing techniques for long running queries over infinite data \n        streams. The main difficulty here is the new model of computation: Instead \n        of being able to re-read data many times and to perform expensive offline \n        computation on a static dataset, we need to compute query answers and \n        maintain summary statistics in an online fashion. Our recent results include \n        computation of correlated aggregates and quantiles over data streams.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Honors/Awards</b><br>\n        IBM Faculty Development Award (2000, 2001).<br>\n        James and Mary Tien Excellence in Teaching Award (2001).</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>University Activities</b><br>\n        Member: Space Committee, Department of Computer Science; Faculty Search \n        Committee, School of <br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operations Research and Industrial Engineering; \n        faculty Search Committee, The Computational and <br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Statistical Genomics Trust.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Profesional Activities</b><br>\n        Program Committees: <br>\n        Twenty-sixth International Conference on Very Large Databases (VLDB), \n        Cairo, Egypt (September, 2000).<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demonstrations Committee. <br>\n        Seventeenth IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE 2001), \n        Heidelberg, Germany (April,<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2001).<br>\n        Fourth International Workshop on Parallel and Distributed Data Mining. \n        Workshop held in conjunction with the<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15th International Parallel and Distributed \n        Processing Symposium, San Francisco, CA (April, 2001).<br>\n        Twentieth ACM SIGMOD Conference (SIGMOD 2001), Santa Barbara, CA (May, \n        2001). <br>\n        ACM SIGMOD Workshop on Research Issues in Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery \n        (DMKD 2001) held in<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cooperation with SIGMOD 2001.

I consider applications in areas ranging from combinatorial \n        design, planning and scheduling, reasoning, multi-agent systems, and machine \n        learning. Recently, I have focused on randomized search techniques. In \n        this work, I study so-called heavy-tailed distributions that characterize \n        complete randomized search methods. A promising way of exploiting heavy-tailed \n        behavior is by combining a suite of search methods into a portfolio, running \n        on a distributed compute cluster. It can be shown that such portfolios \n        dramatically reduce the expected overall computational cost, thereby allowing \n        us to solve large, previously unsolved combinatorial problems. Another \n        recent research direction (joint work with groups at the University of \n        Washington and Microsoft Research) involves the use of machine learning \n        techniques and Bayesian models to develop effective adaptive algorithmic \n        strategies given bounded computational resources. <br>\n        I also established and direct the newly formed Intelligent Information \n        Systems Institute (IISI) at Cornell. The mission of the institute is to \n        foster research in computation and data intensive methods for intelligent \n        decision making systems.

My \n        research is primarily concerned with physically based image synthesis \n        and with applying graphic techniques to a variety of disciplines. My specialties \n        include color science, parallel processing, and realistic image generation. \n        My application work now focuses on medical imaging, architectural design, \n        perception, digital photography, and real-time photorealistic image generation.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent with the interdisciplinary nature \n        of the field of computer graphics, I am a member of Cornell's faculty \n        in Johnson Graduate School of Management, the Department of Computer Science, \n        and the Department of Architecture. In recent years I have taught courses \n        in computer graphics, computer-aided architectural design, digital photography, \n        and disruptive technologies.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was the founding director of the NSF Science \n        and Technology Center for Computer Graphics and Scientific Visualization, \n        now in its eleventh year. I am the director of the Program of Computer \n        Graphics and former director of the Computer-aided Design Instructional \n        Facility at Cornell.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have published more than 200 articles \n        on computer graphics, and many of my students have been highly recognized \n        in the field, including several who have received the SIGGRAPH Achievement \n        Award and others who have received Hollywood Oscars.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1987, I received the ACM Steven Coons \n        Award, the highest honor in the field, for my outstanding creative contributions \n        in computer graphics. I also received the National Computer Graphics Association \n        Academic Award in 1989. In 1997 I received the ASCA Creative Research \n        Award in Architecture. An honorary doctoral degree from New Jersey Institute \n        of Technology was presented to me in 1999.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Professional Activities</b><br>\n        Member: National Academy of Engineering. <br>\n        Fellow: ACM and International Association of Medical and Biological Engineering.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Lectures</b><br>\n        Disruptive Histories of Our Future.

This work has focused on extending the cache \n        coherence mechanism in modern servers to implement active memory operations-computation \n        performed in the memory system on behalf of the microprocessor to speed \n        up overall execution time. Coupled with this work is the exploration of \n        the effect of new networking technologies (i.e. InfiniBand) on next-generation \n        servers and the integration of active memory and I/O techniques with this \n        networking technology. We have also shown that active memory machines \n        and hardware cache-coherent distributed shared-memory (DSM) machines need \n        much the same support, and, in fact, that by building our single-node \n        active memory system we can also support a multiprocessor version of the \n        machine that we call active memory clusters. Active memory clusters can \n        achieve hardware DSM performance at the low cost of clusters.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my work on Active I/O systems I am developing \n        a smart InfiniBand switch (which can also be used in active memory clusters) \n        that can support either normal or intelligent I/O devices, and offload \n        computation from the microprocessor to minimize latency and reduce bandwidth \n        requirements in the I/O system. This work also involves innovative operating \n        system restructuring, including the filesystem and the network stack. \n        The operating system in active I/O systems must be partitioned between \n        the microprocessor and the active I/O devices. Our own operating system, \n        SplitOS, is joint work between our research group and groups at Rutgers \n        and Princeton.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In work on scalable cache coherence protocols, \n        I am working on issues of fairness and robustness in scalable distributed \n        shared-memory (DSM) machines. In addition, I am looking at the quantitative \n        impact of many coherence protocol techniques by evaluating each technique \n        on a flexible DSM prototype. Together with Martin Burtscher, I am also \n        exploring predictive techniques in cache coherence protocols to minimize \n        latency.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Awards/Honors</b><br>\n        Michael Tien '72 Excellence in Teaching Award (2000-2001).<br>\n        IEEE Teacher of the Year Award (1999-2000).<br>\n        NSF Faculty Early Career Development Award (2000-2004).</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>University Activities</b><br>\n        Member: Intelligent Information Systems Institute; ECE Curriculum and \n        Standards Committee; ECE Long-<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Range Recruiting Committee; ECE Experimental \n        Systems Recruiting Committee; ECE Circuits &amp; MEMS<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recruiting Committee; CURIE Summer Program \n        for Women in Engineering; Fields of Electrical <br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Engineering, Computer Science.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Professional Activities</b><br>\n        Publicity Chair: International Symposium on High-performance Computer \n        Architecture (PCA) (January, 2001).<br>\n        Panelist: Mathematics, Information, and Computational Sciences Division \n        within the Office of Advanced <br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scientific Computing Research in the Office \n        of Science at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) (April,<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2001).<br>\n        Program Committee: Workshop on Caching, Coherence, and Consistency (WC3), \n        held in conjunction with the<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ACM Conference on Supercomputing (June, \n        2001).<br>\n        Program Committee: International Conference on Parallel Architectures \n        and Compilation Techniques (PACT)<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (September, 2001).</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Lectures</b><br>\n        Flash Forward: Better, Faster, Cooler.

Varying network capacities, \n        differences in viewing devices, and a broad spectrum of user needs suggest \n        the desirability of coding techniques that can efficiently span large \n        quality and bandwidth ranges. Additionally, coded data must be robust \n        to errors and loss of varying degrees across multiple network segments. \n        For practicality, algorithms must be inexpensive to implement, in either \n        hardware or software. My research interests broadly concern such communication \n        of visual information. Particular topics of interest include multirate \n        video coding and transmission, compression specific to packet networks \n        and other lossy networks, and psychovisual considerations.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>University Activities</b><br>\n        College of Engineering Committee of Faculty Women.<br>\n        Society of Women Engineers Faculty Advisor.<br>\n        EE Curriculum and Standards Committee.<br>\n        Peoplesoft Lab Oversight Committee.<br>\n        EE General Recruiting Committee.<br>\n        Summer presentation to students in \"Inventing an Information Society\" \n        (July, 2000).</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Professional Activities</b><br>\n        Reviewer, IEEE Trans.

The attempt to deal with practical \n        problems (like shape comparison) by investigating their geometric nature, \n        yields a better theoretical understanding of the problems and provides \n        sound and efficient algorithms. Among the theoretical problems I work \n        on are problems in geometric optimization, such as covering a set of points \n        by a given number of shapes and facility location. I have investigated \n        the minimum Hausdorff distance as a tool for measuring shape resemblance \n        between images.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many practical problems in the area of shape comparison \n        seek a fully automated solution. The robustness of the minimum Hausdorff \n        distance lends itself to such problems. In the last two years I have looked \n        into shape comparison problems in three dimensions. Such problems arise \n        in many life-science disciplines. In computational molecular biology I \n        have come up with a new metric, the URMS, to measure substructure resemblance \n        between proteins. This measure has been implemented and further applied \n        to the analysis of molecular dynamics. It proves superior to previously \n        used measures. With the department of life sciences at Ben Gurion University, \n        I have been looking at dendrite shape comparison and classification. Here \n        we applied a three dimensional Hausdorff distance for the problem and \n        are in the midst of devising new measures. </font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Professional Activities</b><br>\n        Chair of the Computer Science Department, Ben-Gurion University of the \n        Negev, Israel.<br>\n        Editorial board: <i>Pattern Recognition Society Journal.</i> <br>\n        Guest editor of <i>Computational Geometry: Theory and Applications</i>.<br>\n        Workshop program committee: Workshop on Algorithmic Engineering (WAE 01) \n        BRICS, University of Aarhus, <br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Denmark (August 28-31, 2001).<br>\n        Reviewer: Israeli-U.S. Bi-national Science Foundation; The Academia - \n        Ministry of Science, Israel; <i>Pattern Recognition Journal; International \n        Journal of Computational Geometry and Applications</i>. </font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Grants:</b><br>\n        LSRT Consortium, \"Optimal Layout Design of Large Scale Satellite \n        Telephony Systems in Rural Regions\" <br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2000-2001).<br>\n        Israeli Defense Ministry, \"BGU Bioinformatics Center for the Interpretation \n        of the Human Genome\" (2001-2002).</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Publications</b><br>\n        \"Optimal Facility Location under Various Distance Functions.\" \n        Accepted for publication in <i>International Journal<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of Computational Geometry and Applications.</i> \n        With S.

One direction I have pursued, \n        motivated by this issue, is the development of algorithms that analyze \n        the link structure of the Web to identify high-quality information resources \n        - hubs and authorities relevant to broad topics. A second direction is \n        the development of graph models that can provide insight into the structure \n        of large networks. I have been studying an algorithmic framework in which \n        to frame questions about certain 'small-world' properties of networks; \n        and with Duncan Callaway, John Hopcroft, Mark Newman, and Steve Strogatz, \n        I have recently looked at models of random graphs that evolve over time. \n        A third line of research has been concerned with designing algorithms \n        that facilitate the rapid spread of information in a network; with David \n        Kempe and Al Demers, I have worked on the design of randomized 'gossip' \n        protocols that provide efficient, decentralized mechanisms for such tasks.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discrete optimization provides a collection \n        of powerful techniques for approaching problems in this area; in particular, \n        balancing constraints imposed by many individuals leads to a range of \n        interesting new problems. With Christos Papadimitriou and Prabhakar Raghavan, \n        I have been studying an optimization-based framework for clustering and \n        data mining in which one has access to data from a large population; we \n        consider the extent to which designing effective algorithms can be balanced \n        with concerns about the privacy of each individual's data. With Amit Kumar, \n        I have been looking at resource allocation problems with multiple users; \n        since each user wants as much of the resource as possible, there are many \n        competing objectives, and it is natural to seek the 'fairest' solution.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, many of the core problems in computational \n        biology require algorithms for analysis of large volumes of data; such \n        data is being generated at an accelerating pace by experimental studies \n        of genomes and proteins across a wide range of species. With Debra Goldberg, \n        Susan McCouch, and David Liben-Nowell, I have been investigating mathematical \n        and computational approaches to the analysis of evolutionary relationships \n        among species at the genomic level and the connection between this type \n        of analysis and the problem of comparative mapping. I have also developed \n        algorithms for relating sequence information to protein structure, and \n        with Ron Elber I am continuing to look at approaches to this issue based \n        on threading methods.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Awards</b><br>\n        National Academy of Sciences Award for Initiatives in Research (2001).<br>\n        David and Lucile Packard Foundation Fellowship (1999-2004).<br>\n        ONR Young Investigator Award (1999-2002).<br>\n        NSF Faculty Early Career Development Award(1997-2001).<br>\n        Alfred P.

In my guise as an administrator, \n        I manage the Computing Facilities Support group and worry about a number \n        of issues including computer security, networking, and building web services. \n        Most recently, as part of the Nomad research project (<a href=\"http://www.nomad.cornell.edu\">http://www.nomad.cornell.edu</a>), \n        I have been leading a campus-wide pilot of megabit-speed wireless LAN \n        technology. This will be rolled out by Cornell Information Technologies \n        as a Cornell campus service in the fall 2001.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the research side, I am part of the Cornell \n        Digital Libraries Research Group (CDLRG - <a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/cdlrg\">http://www.cs.cornell.edu/cdlrg</a>). \n        A major focus of our effort is on interoperability issues for digital \n        libraries. As part of that broader thrust, I am a Co-principal Investigator \n        on the NSF-funded National Science Digital Library Project at Cornell \n        (<a href=\"http://www.SiteForScience.org\">http://www.SiteForScience.org</a>). \n        My own particular interests focus on ensuring the availability in the \n        digital world of pre-digital published and manuscript materials, as well \n        as related issues on copyright, the public domain, and public access to \n        older and out-of-print materials.</font></p>\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b><a name=\"kreitz\"></a></b></font></p>\n      <p><img src=\"images/KREITZ.jpg\" width=\"121\" height=\"163\"></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Cristoph Kreitz<br>\n        Senior Research Associate<br>\n        kreitz@cs.cornell.edu<br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kreitz\">http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kreitz</a><br>\n        Ph.D. FernUniversitaet Hagen, 1984</b><br>\n        <br>\n        My primary research interest is the application of automated deduction \n        to the design, verification, and optimization of software systems. My \n        current research aims at developing a Logical Programming Environment \n        for the construction of reliable and efficient distributed systems. In \n        collaboration with the Nuprl and Ensemble research groups, I have built \n        semantics-based tools for the automatic optimization of protocol stacks \n        in the Ensemble group communication system. More recently, Robbert van \n        Renesse, Mark Bickford and I have developed a generic switching protocol \n        for the construction of adaptive systems and proved it correct with the \n        Nuprl proof development system. For this purpose, we introduced the concept \n        of meta-properties and used them to characterize communication properties \n        that can be preserved by switching. We also identified switching invariants \n        that an implementation of the switching protocol must satisfy in order \n        to work correctly. The verification efforts revealed a variety of implicit \n        assumptions that are usually made when designing communication systems \n        and uncovered minor design errors that would otherwise have made their \n        way into the implementation.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also interested in the development \n        of automatic proof procedures for classical and non-classical logics. \n        Together with former students from the Technical University of Darmstadt, \n        I work on proof search methods based on matrix-characterizations of logical \n        validity, a very compact representation of the search space. We have developed \n        a uniform proof search procedure for classical logic, intuitionistic logic, \n        various modal logics, fragments of linear logic, and for inductive specification \n        proofs. We have also developed a uniform algorithm for transforming the \n        machine-found matrix proofs into sequent proofs. In the past year, we \n        implemented JProver, a first-order intuitionistic theorem prover that \n        creates sequent-style proof objects, and connected it as external proof \n        engine to the interactive proof assistants Nuprl and MetaPRL. The combination \n        of these systems gives a user the full expressive power of the proof assistant \n        when dealing with complex proofs and verifications, while at the same \n        time taking advantage of well-understood and efficient proof techniques \n        for subproblems that only depend on first-order reasoning.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Professional Activities</b><br>\n        Program Committee: IJCAR Workshop on Verification (2001).<br>\n        Referee: <i>Handbook of Automated Reasoning; Journal of Symbolic Computation; \n        Journal of Functional Programming.</i><br>\n        <br>\n        <b>Lectures</b><br>\n        The NuPRL Open Logical Environment.

However, because of the subtleties of human \n        language, this goal cannot be achieved without access to large quantities \n        of high-quality linguistic and domain knowledge. A major focus of my research \n        is the development of \"knowledge-lean\" methods to overcome this \n        knowledge acquisition bottleneck: I am investigating techniques that allow \n        a system to automatically learn the requisite information directly from \n        text.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent work continues to explore the use \n        of distributional similarity as a powerful tool for bootstrapping the \n        knowledge acquisition process. The underlying idea is quite intuitive: \n        information about an object can be gleaned from the objects that are similar \n        to it, where similarity can be computed from unannotated data alone. But \n        there are a multitude of ways to implement this idea; we are currently \n        investigating different similarity-based paradigms, both theoretically \n        and through experiments on large datasets.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, work with Rie Kubota Ando has analyzed \n        Latent Semantic Indexing, a commonly-used and highly influential information \n        retrieval technique that seeks to uncover hidden document relationships \n        without engaging in standard natural language processing. We have shown \n        that the performance of this algorithm can be tied to the uniformity of \n        the underlying topic-document distribution, and we have provided a new \n      algorithm that automatically compensates for distributional non-uniformity.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Professional Activities</b><br>\n        Program Chair: 2001 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language \n        Processing (EMNLP). <br>\n        Area Chair (Corpus-based Natural Language Processing): Thirty-ninth Annual \n        Meeting of the Association for<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Computational Linguistics (ACL).<br>\n        Workshops Chair: Second Conference of the North American Chapter of the \n        Association for Computational <br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Linguistics (NAACL).<br>\n        Editorial Board: Computational Linguistics (2000-2002).<br>\n        Editorial Board: Machine Learning (2001-2004).<br>\n        Program Committee: Second Conference of the North American Chapter of \n        the Association for Computational <br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Linguistics (NAACL) (2001).<br>\n        Program Committee: Third Conference on Recent Advances in Natural Language \n        Processing (RANLP) (2001).<br>\n        Co-organizer: Text Learning: Beyond Supervision, a workshop at the Seventeenth \n        International Joint<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI).<br>\n        Invited Participant: Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) \n        Workshop on Mathematical <br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foundations of Natural Language Modeling \n        (2000).<br>\n        Member: NSF review panel.<br>\n        Technical coordinator: joint study agreement between Cornell University \n        and IBM Watson on text mining and <br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; document management, 1999-present.<br>\n        Affiliated faculty: Intelligent Information Systems Institute.<br>\n        Referee: ACM Transactions on Information Systems.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>University Activities</b><br>\n        Department of Computer Science liaison to the Department of Linguistics.<br>\n        Member: Women in Science and Engineering Advisory Group.<br>\n        Member: Women in Science and Engineering Term Chair Award committee.<br>\n        Reader: Arts and Sciences Undergraduate Admissions.<br>\n        Member: Field of cognitive studies.<br>\n        Affiliated faculty: Cornell Information Science program.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Lectures</b><br>\n        Distributional Similarity: Models and Methods.

I am particularly interested in exploring how language \n        technology can be used to build reliable, secure, and high-performance \n        systems software. The unifying thread for all my research is the application \n        of advanced semantic constructs in real-world applications.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I have concentrated on type systems \n        and logics for enforcing security properties in low-level code. One byproduct \n        of this research is the design of a type system called TAL (<a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/talc/\">Typed \n        Assembly Language</a>) for the Intel x86 architecture and a suite of tools \n        that can efficiently type check binary code. The TAL type system is sufficiently \n        expressive that we can efficiently compile a variety of high-level safe \n        languages, such as ML, Scheme, Safe-C, and Java, to type-correct assembly \n        code. This technology provides a means to safely extend systems such as \n        kernels, web browsers, or hand-helds without the overheads of a virtual \n        machine or just-in-time compiler. Recent work on TAL includes extending \n        the type system to provide enforcement of other security policies, such \n        as resource constraints, that are outside the scope of traditional type \n        systems. I am also studying how other language technologies, such as binary \n        rewriting and inlined reference monitors, can be combined with types and \n        logics to support a wider class of important security properties. <br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another interest is in language, compiler, \n        and runtime support for application-specific memory management. Though \n        standard garbage collection techniques provide a safe and convenient programming \n        model, many systems applications cannot tolerate the overheads introduced \n        by a general-purpose collector. My research here focuses on a range of \n        topics from fast conservative garbage collectors to advanced type systems \n        for region-based memory management, to generalizations of linear type \n        systems. The goal in all of this work is to provide the programmer with \n        more control over memory management without sacrificing safety. <br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My other recent interests are in run-time \n        code generation and modal type systems, efficient data representation, \n        and rich forms of polymorphism. Many of these issues are being explored \n        in the context of Cyclone, a next-generation systems language that is \n        being developed jointly between researchers at Cornell and AT&amp;T Laboratories.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Awards</b><br>\n        Allen Newell Medal for Research Excellence (2001).<br>\n        Ralph Watts Excellence in Teaching Award (2001).<br>\n        Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (2000).<br>\n        NSF Faculty Early Career Development Award (1999).<br>\n        Sloan Fellow (1998).</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>University Activities</b><br>\n        Ph.D. admissions committee (1998-2000).<br>\n        ECE hiring committee (2000).</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Professional Activities</b><br>\n        Editor: <i>Journal of Functional Programming</i>.<br>\n        Associate Editor: <i>ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems</i>.<br>\n        Member: IFIP Working Group 2.8 on Functional Programming.<br>\n        Participant: INFOSEC Research Council Study Group on Malicious Code; DARPA \n        ISAT Study on Mobile<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Code.<br>\n        Program Committee: Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (PoPL \n        2001); International <br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP \n        2000); Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (PPDP 2000); International Symposium on \n        Memory Management (ISMM 2000); Principles of Programming<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Languages (PoPL 2002); Workshop on Semantics, \n        Applications, and Implementation of Program<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generation (SAIG 2001); Workshop on Multi-language \n        Infrastructure and Interoperability (BABEL 2001).</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Lectures</b><br>\n        Language-based Security.

Programming language ideas can \n        be applied effectively to problems in security, systems, and databases. \n        I am particularly interested in using language-level information to improve \n        security guarantees, performance, and transparency for distributed systems \n        and mobile code. <br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One example of this approach is our current \n        work on the problem of protecting confidential data. Current trends are \n        making this problem both more important and more difficult. Computer systems \n        are nearly completely connected via the Internet, allowing software to \n        disseminate private information to almost any location. In addition, we \n        increasingly use untrusted software; for example, downloaded software \n        such as applets. Standard access-control mechanisms are inadequate because \n        they do not control information propagation.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Static information control is a promising \n        approach for confidentiality. Our programming language <a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/jif/\">Jif \n        </a>judiciously extends Java with privacy annotations that facilitate \n        static analysis of information flows within programs. We are applying \n        the Jif programming model to distributed systems, in which not only programs \n        but also hosts may be untrusted. Computations spanning a network require \n        a protocol for the communicating hosts; we can show through static analysis \n        of such a distributed program when its protocol releases unintended information \n        to untrusted hosts participating in the computation. To develop a theory \n        for the security of such programs in the presence of downgrading channels, \n        we have introduced the idea of 'robust declassification,' which captures \n        the idea that untrusted hosts are unable to exploit these channels.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Professional Activities</b><br>\n        Program Committee Member: 2001 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy; \n        18th ACM Symposium on <br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operating Systems Principles (SOSP).</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Lectures</b><br>\n        Protecting Confidentiality Against Untrusted Programs and Hosts.

Our goal is to develop the algorithms and tools that are \n        required to raise the level of abstraction at which people program computers, \n        freeing them from having to worry about low-level details of machine architectures, \n        memory hierarchies, etc.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current focus is making programs adapt \n        to hardware faults. This problem has been studied by the operating systems \n        community, but proposed solutions such as message logging have a large \n        run-time overhead. We are developing program analysis and transformation \n        techniques to reduce this run-time overhead by exploiting information \n        about program behavior that can be deduced at compile-time. We plan to \n        deploy these techniques in the Adaptive Software Project, which is a multi-year, \n        multi-institutional project funded by the NSF as part of its Information \n        Technology Research (ITR) initiative.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have continued our work on technology \n        for optimizing the performance of programs running on machines with deep \n        memory hierarchies. A recent break-through was the invention of fractal \n        symbolic analysis, which is a powerful program analysis technique that \n        permits compilers to restructure complicated programs far beyond the reach \n        of conventional compilers that use dependence analysis. Traditional symbolic \n        analysis is powerful but it is intractable for most programs. To circumvent \n        this problem, fractal symbolic analysis analyzes a program and its transformed \n        version by repeatedly simplifying these programs until symbolic analysis \n        becomes tractable, ensuring that equality of simplified programs is sufficient \n        to guarantee equality of the original programs. We have shown that this \n        approach is adequate for restructuring codes like LU factorization with \n        pivoting, which have not yielded to previous techniques in the literature. \n        The fractal approach to analysis is likely to prove useful for proving \n        other program properties.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are continuing our work on next-generation \n        generic programming techniques. In our approach, algorithm implementors \n        use a different API than data structure designers, and the gap between \n        these APIs is bridged by a compiler. One view of this approach is that \n        it exploits restructuring compiler technology to perform a novel kind \n        of template instantiation. We are demonstrating the usefulness of this \n        new technology by deploying it in a system that generates efficient sparse \n        codes from high-level algorithms and specifications of sparse matrix formats.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These ongoing projects build on our earlier \n        work on restructuring compilation technology. Our group implemented one \n        of the first compilers that generated code for distributed memory machines, \n        starting from sequential shared memory programs. We introduced techniques \n        called runtime resolution and owner-computes rule, which have now become \n        standard in the area. Our work on linear loop transformations for enhancing \n        parallelism and locality has been incorporated by Hewlett-Packard into \n        its entire compiler product line. We also developed fast algorithms for \n        program analysis problems such as computing the control dependence relation, \n        the static single assignment form of a program, and dataflow analyses. \n        Many of these algorithms have been incorporated into commercial and research \n        compilers.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>University Activities</b><br>\n        Member: Cornell Theory Center Advisory Committee.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Professional Activities</b><br>\n        Program Committee: ACM Symposium on Programming Languages Design and Implementation \n        (PLDI '01); <br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; International Conference on Supercomputing \n        (ICS '01); EuroPar '01, Supercomputing 2001; HiPC 2001.<br>\n        Consultant: Grammatech Inc. <br>\n        Referee/Reviewer: <i>ACM TOPLAS; IEEE Trans.

We have developed and implemented a grammatical formalism \n        known as head-lexicalized probabilistic context free grammar and have \n        employed it in large-scale experiments on German and English concerned \n        with learning lexical information from text corpora. The methods have \n        the status of a basic language technology, which can be applied in numerous \n        ways in research and applications. My own interests relate mainly to scientific \n        research in linguistics, particularly syntax, semantics and lexical semantics.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work aims to devolop an experimental \n        paradigm for work in linguistics in which lingustic events are observed \n        in large text corpora using a robust parser and used to develop and test \n        theories. Linguistic theory is placed in contact with observations on \n        a massive scale using mixed numerical/symbolic comptutational models, \n        and much relevant knowledge is learned from data using numerical optimization \n        algorithms.<br>\n        The linguistic representations assumed in this work are those of linguistic \n        theory, for instance grammars, labeled trees and structured lexical entries. \n        In the numerical modeling component, grammars and the lexicon are given \n        a probabilistic interpretation, as defining a parameterized family of \n        probability distributions. Many problems can then be solved using probabilistic \n        optimization algorithms. For instance, inducing a lexicon from a text \n        corpus amounts to maximizing a certain polynomial.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also work on the semantics of human languages, \n        using logical and denotational-semantic techniques. Currently, I am investigating \n        connections between the syntax and semantics of elliptical constructions \n        and the semantics and phonology of intonation.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>University Activities</b><br>\n        Administration of Computational Linguistics Lab.<br>\n        Graduate Admissions Committee.<br>\n        Phonetics Search Committee.<br>\n        Founders' Committee, Faculty of Computing and Information.<br>\n        Social Sciences Advisory Council.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Professional Activities</b><br>\n        2000 Workshop on Language Engineering, Johns Hopkins University.

My recent work \n        focuses on applying mathematical techniques of deterministic uncertainty \n        to enhance methods of structural engineering analysis. I am applying one \n        such technique, called Interval Analysis, which adapts traditional numerical \n        operations by replacing numbers with intervals that model uncertain values. \n        This set-based form of structural analysis uses discrete mathematics to \n        perform types of parametric studies, that traditional techniques cannot. \n        However, the interval approach introduces numerical inaccuracies in solutions \n        that map to infeasible structural behaviors. A major goal of this research \n        involves improving the quality of the interval-based solutions to reduce \n        these inaccuracies to produce a technique suitable for design engineers.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year I restructured the introductory \n        programming courses to update the technology and problem-solving tools \n        being taught. For the first time, students were introduced to Maple in \n        CS99, a preliminary course in programming that provides experience to \n        students before they take other courses. MATLAB has also received greater \n        focus in a new introductory programming course, CS100M. It has generated \n        quite a bit of excitement from students and other universities because \n        of the equal focus on both MATLAB and Java to help teach programming using \n        problems of computational science. I have also been coordinating the Computer \n        Science Department's \"short courses,\" which are 1-credit courses \n        taught by Ph.D. students. These courses focus on teaching computer languages \n        and help the student instructors gain teaching experience. The instructors \n        turn to me for advice on curriculum development, teaching methods, and \n        navigating university policies. I have created a new short course, CS214: \n        Advanced UNIX Tools, which will be taught for the first time in the next \n        academic year.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing my work from spring 2000, colleagues \n        in the College of Engineering and I converted the pilot CS100 Academic \n        Excellence Workshop (AEW) into a full-fledged program that runs in conjunction \n        with CS100M. We continued to pilot AEWs for CS100J, which is the more \n        traditional programming course. The AEW fosters cooperative learning, \n        where students work in teams to solve challenging problems in a non-competitive \n        environment. Students have responded enthusiastically, so we began designing \n        a new lab in spring 2001 to expand our capacity, especially to help the \n        CS100J pilot grow. Since AEWs tend to entice students, especially women \n        and minorities, we will be tracking engineering and computer science enrollments \n        in the next academic year to measure the effectiveness of our AEW program \n        in increasing diversity in the sciences. I look forward to working on \n        the CS AEW with Daisy Fan, whom I recruited into the department.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>University Activities</b><br>\n        Faculty Advisor: Association of Computer Science Undergraduates.<br>\n        Coordinator: Academic Excellence Workshop (AEW) for CS100 program.<br>\n        Coordinator: departmental short-course advice and instruction.<br>\n        Member: Student Experience Committee.<br>\n        Member: Computing Policy Committee.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Professional Activities</b><br>\n        Textbook Reviewer: McGraw-Hill.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Lectures</b><br>\n        The Inexperienced Educator's Guide To Managing A Large Hierarchical Staff. \n        Emerging Technologies for Industry and Education, Annual Meeting of the \n        St. Lawrence Section, American Society Engineering Education (March, 2001).</font></p>\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><a name=\"selman\"></a><b></b></font></p>\n      <p><img src=\"images/SELMAN.jpg\" width=\"108\" height=\"143\"></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Bart Selman<br>\n        Associate Professor<br>\n        selman@cs.cornell.edu<br>\n        <a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/selman\">http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/selman</a><br>\n        Ph.D. University of Toronto, 1991</b></font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\">The focus of my research \n        is on computation intensive methods in artificial intelligence, in particular \n        fast general reasoning, search, and planning techniques. I also investigate \n        the various sources of complexity in hard computational problems. In this \n        work, I explore connections between computer science, artificial intelligence, \n        and statistical physics. In addition, I study issues in problem representation, \n        including the robustness of encodings, abstraction, compilation, and approximation \n        methods. These issues are critical to the successful application of reasoning \n        and search methods in realistic domains. In terms of applications, I consider \n        challenge problems from planning, knowledge representation, multi-agent \n        systems, and machine learning. Our planning system, Black Box, developed \n        jointly with Henry Kautz of the University of Washington, is one of the \n        fastest general purpose planning systems. Finally, in recent projects, \n        I am exploring connections between machine learning methods and reasoning \n        and planning techniques. In joint work with groups at the University of \n        Washington and Microsoft Research, I study the use of Bayesian machine \n        learning techniques for dynamic adaptive control of computational resources.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Awards</b><br>\n        Fellow: American Association for Artificial Intelligence.<br>\n        Alfred P.

However, \n        in practice, real-world inputs for some NP-hard optimization problems \n        are straightforward to solve, whereas for others, even quite modestly \n        sized inputs are beyond the limits of the most sophisticated methods. \n        Analogously, from a theoretical perspective, for some NP-hard optimization \n        problems it is possible to efficiently compute solutions that are guaranteed \n        to be arbitrarily close to optimal, whereas for others, computing even \n        a crude approximation to the optimum is also NP-hard. In fact, the extent \n        to which such approximation algorithms exist for a problem provides a \n        surprisingly accurate theoretical yardstick for its actual computational \n        difficulty.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our work has been motivated by the fact \n        that certain linear programming relaxations have been shown to provide \n        extremely good lower bounds on typical data. We provided a theoretical \n        understanding of the strength of these bounds by designing algorithms \n        that \"round\" the fractional solutions to these linear programs \n        to nearby integer solutions without degrading the quality of the solution \n        too much. We have been investigating a variety of clustering problems, \n        and in joint work with Moses Charikar, Sudipto Guha, and Eva Tardos, we \n        have obtained the first constant factor approximation algorithm for the \n        k-median problem. We have also obtained improved approximation algorithms \n        for the uncapacitated facility location problem (in joint work with Fabian \n        Chudak) and for a variety of more general multi-level facility location \n        problems (in joint work with Karen Aardal and F. Chudak, and with Nathan \n        Edwards). For the former problem, not only is the theoretical performance \n        of our algorithm surprisingly good, but it is more effective in practice \n        than all previously known heuristic procedures for this problem. We have \n        also been investigating the application of some of these rounding methods \n        to problems arising in computational genomics, in joint work with Dan \n        Brown and the group in plant sciences at Cornell, working under Steve \n        Tanksley. The resulting software for computing genetic linkage maps has \n        already seen widespread application within the genomics community.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>University Activities</b><br>\n        Member: Search Committee for Dean of the Graduate School.<br>\n        Member: Genomics Task Force.<br>\n        Member: FCI Working Group on Computational Biology.<br>\n        Member: FCI Working Group on Computational Science.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Professional Activities</b><br>\n        Editor-in-chief: <i>SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics</i>. <br>\n        Editor: <i>SIAM Journal on Computing</i>. <br>\n        Co-editor: <i>SIAM/MPS Series on Optimization</i>.<br>\n        Associate Editor: Mathematics of Operations Research; Mathematical Programming; \n        Journal of Scheduling. <br>\n        Guest Editor: J. `of Algorithms (Special issue devoted to selected papers \n        of the 11th Annual Symposium on Discrete Algorithms). <br>\n        <br>\n        </font><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Lectures</b><br>\n        Approximation Algorithms for Facility Location Problems. <br>\n        -.

Ad-hoc networking is a newly emerging computing \n        paradigm where disparate, mobile hosts form temporary alliances to accomplish \n        certain tasks. They naturally arise in many real-world settings including \n        disaster relief operations, smart vehicles, and distributed sensor networks. \n        Such ad-hoc settings, characterized by constant change and limited resources, \n        require a high degree of adaptability and resource awareness from applications. \n        Current state of the art, however, requires all such functionality to \n        be manually encoded by the application programmer.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are currently building an operating system, \n        called <a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/egs/magnetos/\">MagnetOS</a>, \n        that provides automatic and transparent distribution of ad-hoc networking \n        applications. MagnetOS makes an entire ad-hoc network appear as a single \n        Java virtual machine to applications. By transparently migrating application \n        components from node to node, MagnetOS can increase system longevity, \n        reduce application delays, and decrease bandwidth consumption, even in \n        the presence of conflicting applications. Consequently, MagnetOS simplifies \n        application design, increases application portability by obviating error-prone \n        manual coding, and achieves an efficient placement of application components \n        within the network that adapt to changes in resource availability and \n        connectivity.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with MagnetOS, we are examining \n        the design of secure, energy efficient operating systems for small, embedded \n        computers. Newly emerging smart cards, which are capable of downloading \n        and executing arbitrary code, are becoming part of our critical infrastructure \n        as they are being deployed in financial and telecommunications networks. \n        We are looking at different strategies for testing their security, as \n        well as evaluating code verification techniques for such severely resource-constrained \n        systems.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third research direction looks at distributed \n        systems at the opposite end of the spectrum; namely, the high-performance \n        clusters that make up web sites. We are developing techniques for formally \n        specifying and reasoning about the interfaces they expose to the rest \n        of the network, as well as techniques for enforcing a security policy \n        uniformly across a web site. </font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Lectures</b><br>\n        Distributed Virtual Machines: A New System Architecture for Networked \n        Computers (March-May, 2000).<br>\n        A New System Architecture for Ubiquitous Computing.

Brazos is a high performance parallel \n        programming environment distinguished by its use of multithreading, selective \n        multicast, a software-only implementation of scope consistency, and several \n        adaptive runtime performance tuning mechanisms. Brazos supports both shared \n        memory and message passing programming styles, and provides very efficient \n        mechanisms for thread migration and checkpoint/recovery. Currently, my \n        research on parallel programming runtime systems includes the development \n        a version of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) that provides thread \n        migration between nodes in a cluster for load balancing, fault tolerance, \n        and higher performance.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergence of ubiquitous communication \n        infrastructure and high performance, low power computing resources challenges \n        us to explore a better alternative to the current fragmentation of data, \n        applications, and devices that many users are faced with today. The Bifrost \n        location independent computing project seeks to provide a flexible and \n        comprehensive information access environment. The function of Bifrost \n        is to provide location and device independent access to data. Data in \n        Bifrost encompasses both information and the applications used to manipulate \n        that information. Bifrost uses affinity between data, and between users \n        and data, to make decisions about when and where to move data. We refer \n        to this approach as affinity directed mobility.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core research issues of the project \n        are mobility management (how we move data and threads to support user \n        and device mobility), data management (how we represent, access, update, \n        and protect information), and application management (how we provide system-wide \n        access to application data). In contrast to previous approaches to mobile \n        data management that employ hoarding in anticipation of disconnection, \n        Bifrost anticipates \"connection elsewhere\" instead of disconnection. \n        Our rationale for this \"almost always connected\" approach is \n        as follows: We project that in 3-5 years, the situation will exist in \n        which users will be able to be in an \"always connected\" state, \n        connected almost anytime and anywhere that they choose. Wireless access \n        points (e.g., 802.11, infrared, and Bluetooth) will be common, even ubiquitous, \n        in nearly every home and public place, as they are today in many situations \n        including coffee shops, airports, and office buildings. Additionally, \n        services such as Infared and Bluetooth will allow connection to the Internet \n        in nearly any setting from almost anywhere. In this situation, the problem \n        of how a user can have unilateral access to any piece of remote personal \n        data, regardless of device or location, becomes increasingly important. \n        Thus Bifrost seeks to provide a common data access model, and exploring \n        the design space while providing a rich set of tools for the manipulation \n        and sharing of personal data is a core focus of the proposed research. \n        </font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>University or Professional \n        Activities</b><br>\n        Member: ECE Curriculum and Standard Committee.<br>\n        Member: Faculty Advisory Board on Information Technologies.<br>\n        Reviewer: <i>Transactions of Parallel and Distributed Computing</i>.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Lectures</b><br>\n        WSDLite: A Lightweight Alternative to Windows Sockets Direct Path.

Creating these \n        scientific applications poses a number of difficulties for computational \n        scientists. First, these applications are often very complex and may contain \n        hundreds of thousands, and even millions of lines of code. Furthermore, \n        these applications are intended to run on the most advanced, high performance \n        supercomputers. I am interested in developing software that helps to reduce \n        the development cost of these applications. One way to do this is to raise \n        the level of abstraction of programming languages and software libraries \n        in order to bring them closer to the programmer's natural domain of discourse. \n        In order to do this, specialized compilers and other program transformation \n        systems are required in order to transform these abstractions into efficient \n        executable programs.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example of this is the work that I have \n        done on sparse compilers with Keshav Pingali and his students. Matrix \n        computations, such as those that perform linear algebra operations, are \n        very naturally expressed using Fortran or Matlab style loops and arrays. \n        However, many matrices that arise in scientific applications are sparse, \n        which means that they consist almost entirely (&gt;99%) of zero values. \n        Modifying matrix algorithms to use special-purpose sparse matrix data \n        structures is a complicated and error-prone process. We have developed \n        software that allows the programmer to express their matrix computations \n        and sparse matrix data structures separately and in their most natural \n        representation. Then, we use program transformations to combine the algorithms \n        and data structures into a single, efficient executable.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area in which I am working is that \n        of fault-tolerance for scientific applications. Very few scientific applications \n        would be considered \"mission-critical,\" but many do run for \n        very long periods of time (e.g., for weeks or months) or in environments \n        in which failures are likely to occur (e.g., the desktop workstations \n        within a department). We are currently investigating a number of different \n        approaches for providing fault-tolerance for scientific applications, \n        but one thing is already clear: different applications running on different \n        computers call for different fault-tolerance solutions. A programmer would \n        certainly like to have their application run in many different computing \n        environments, but interfacing with a number of fault-tolerant systems \n        is not usually realistic. In order to provide a single interface from \n        the programmer's point of view, we are investigating a number of implementation \n        techniques involving software library and program transformation technology. \n        This work is being done as part of a project on Adaptive Software with \n        researchers from other departments here at Cornell, Mississippi State \n        University, the College of William and Mary, and other institutions.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from my core research agenda, I have \n        worked closely with computational scientists in order to develop novel, \n        high-performance, scientific applications. Apart from being interesting \n        in its own right, this work has given me insight into scientific programming \n        that I have found extremely valuable in my research on program transformations. \n        The most important project that I have been involved with was the Crack \n        Propagation for Teraflop Computers (CPTC) project, whose goal was to develop \n        fracture mechanics software that incorporated a number of recent advances \n        in numerical analysis and computational geometry and which delivered very \n        high performance on teraflop-scale computers.

I am mostly \n        working on problems that involve graphs or networks. <br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One general area of my research is designing \n        fast algorithms that provide provably close-to-optimal results for NP-hard \n        problems. Although research on polynomial time approximation algorithms \n        started in the1970s soon after the discovery of NP-completeness, it has \n        truly blossomed only in the past decade. Amazing progress has occurred \n        both in our ability to design approximation algorithms, and in proving \n        limits to approximability. Over the last years I have been working on \n        different approximation algorithms on various basic combinatorial problems. \n        I have worked on algorithms for various cut problems, and clustering type \n        problems. These problems are motivated by applications arising in vision, \n        networking and clustering. <br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also working on the interface of algorithms \n        and game theory. Approximation algorithms provide a tool for understanding \n        issues in game theory, such as evaluating and designing multi-agent games. \n        Such games underlie many phenomena in networking. In joint work with Tim \n        Roughgarden, I worked on understanding the quality of routing obtained \n        if separate agents each make selfish routing decisions in a global network. \n        Our goal is to understand the tradeoffs between introducing a global control \n        mechanism, and the loss in quality obtained by letting each agent make \n        selfish decisions. We use a model where each link in a network has a delay \n        that is an arbitrary monotone and continuous function of the amount of \n        flow on the link. We compare the quality of such a Nash equilibrium with \n        a globally planned optimal routing whose goal is to minimize the sum of \n        all delays. In the case of linear delay functions, we show that the global \n        optimum can be at most a factor of four-thirds better than the Nash equilibrium. \n        For more general delay functions, the value of the global optimum can \n        be arbitrarily better than the Nash equilibrium even when the delay functions \n        are rather simple. On the other hand, we show that for any monotone and \n        continuous delay function the cost of a Nash equilibrium is at most as \n        much as the optimal for the case in which each agent has to send twice \n        as much flow. Roughly speaking, this shows that one can eliminate the \n        need for introducing a global control mechanism at the cost of designing \n        a network that can support twice as much flow. <br>\n        <br>\n        <b>Awards</b> <br>\n        Fellow: American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2001).<br>\n        Fellow: ACM (1998). <br>\n        Faculty of the Year: Association of Computer Science Undergraduates. </font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>University Activities</b><br>\n        Director of Graduate Studies: Computer Science Department, Cornell University<br>\n        Member: Fields of Operations Research and Applied Mathematics <br>\n        Member: FACTA, Faculty Advisory Committee on Tenure and Appointment. <br>\n        Member: WISE, Advisory group on Women in Science and Engineering.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Professional Activities</b><br>\n        DIMACS External Advisory Board member, since 1996. <br>\n        Co-organizer: DIMACS special year on Computational Intractability in1999-2001. \n        <br>\n        Area editor for <i>Discrete Optimization: Mathematics of Operations Research</i>. \n        <br>\n        Editor: <i>SIAM Journal of Computer Science; Chicago Journal of Theoretical \n        Computer Science; Combinatorica; Journal of Interconnection Networks</i>.<br>\n        Program committee: International Workshop on Randomization and Approximation \n        Techniques in Computer<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Science (APPROX), 2000; ACM-SIAM Symposium \n        on Discrete Algorithms (SODA) 2001; ACM<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Symposium on the Theory of Computing (STOC) \n        2001.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Lectures</b><br>\n        A Classification Problem Related to Multi-way Cuts.

Pointer analysis can be used \n        so that indirect loads and stores through pointers are taken into account, \n        as well as indirect function calls. Dataflow analysis can be used so that \n        links between unrelated assignments and uses are excluded. Operations \n        that highlight forward and backward slices show the impact of a given \n        statement on the rest of the program (forward slicing) and the impact \n        of the rest of a program on a given statement (backward slicing). Operations \n        that highlight paths between nodes in the dependence graph (chops) show \n        ways in which the program points are interdependent (or independent).<br>\n        Uses of slicing and chopping include software development, maintenance \n        and re-engineering of legacy code, test-data generation, security-assurance \n        and safety-assurance inspection, and semantic interference checking in \n        configuration management systems.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am working with Ph.D. student Lyn Millett, \n        who is studying program dependence-graphs and slicing of concurrent programs.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"> [On leave spring \n        2001.]</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Professional Activities</b><br>\n        Co-founder and Chairman: GrammaTech, Inc.<br>\n        Member: Science and Technology Study Group, Infosec Research Council (October \n        1999-May 2000).<br>\n        <br>\n        <b>Lectures</b><br>\n        Static-semantic analysis based on dependence graphs.

Those specifications were only applicable to preprint-related metadata, \n        but nevertheless attracted the interest from communities outside of the \n        preprint realm. It was decided to revise the specification in depth, in \n        order to extend its applicability to metadata in general. The revision \n        process took 5 months. In that timeframe, a meeting was organized to discuss \n        issues involved in the generalization; several versions of a new protocol \n        document were compiled; an alpha-testing group consisting of 14 international \n        parties was assembled with the aim of testing and refining those versions. \n        In January 2001, the Metadata Harvesting Protocol of the Open Archives \n        Initiative was publicly released at a meeting in Washington DC. Carl Lagoze \n        (Cornell University CS) and I were appointed Executives of the Open Archives \n        Initiative, overseeing and coordinating the technical activities of the \n        Initiative. The Digital Library Federation and the Coalition for Networked \n        Information provide support for those activities. The Metadata Harvesting \n        protocol attracts broad international attention, and several funding agencies \n        explicitly or implicitly call for proposals that build on the protocol.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Important progress was also made in the \n        realm of the open reference-linking track of my work. With Patrick Hochstenbach \n        (Ghent University) and Oren Beit-Arie (Ex Libris USA), I had publicly \n        released a draft OpenURL specification in January 2000. The OpenURL specification \n        enables open reference linking by:<br>\n        Allowing one to reference a scholarly object-as well as elements that \n        describe the context in which the reference is provided-in a consistent \n        way as name=value pairs on an HTTP GET or POST URL. <br>\n        Allowing for the transfer of that reference-as well as of the contextual \n        elements-to a linking server.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2001, I filed for standardization \n        of the OpenURL with NISO. Soon thereafter, the standardization request \n        was granted, and a formal standardization committee was formed. Meanwhile, \n        the draft OpenURL specification has already gained broad acceptance in \n        the scholarly information industry, with leading companies such as ISI, \n        EBSCO, Swets, SilverPlatter, etc. supporting it in their production systems. \n        Also, an important OpenURL-based prototype was set up with DOI/CrossRef \n        to demonstrate the feasibility of open reference linking based on DOIs.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Professional Activities</b><br>\n        Member: Steering Committee, Open Archives Initiative. <br>\n        Executive: Open Archives Initiative. <br>\n        Technical Committee: Open Archives Initiative. <br>\n        Research Advisory Board: OCLC. <br>\n        NISO Committee AX (OpenURL standardization)<br>\n        Co-organizer: Open Archives Initiative Meeting, Washington DC (January, \n        2001).<br>\n        Workshop on the Open Archives Initiative and peer-review journals in Europe, \n        Geneva (March, 2001). </font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Lectures</b><br>\n        Interconnecting Distributed Scholarly Information Resources in a Context \n        Sensitive Manner.

My research is on the design and analysis of such algorithms. \n        Two Ph.D. students, V. Howle and G. Jonsson (both of the Center for Applied \n        Mathematics), completed their Ph.D.s working with me during the past year. \n        Howle's thesis was on algorithms for modeling and simulation of AC electric \n        power networks. Utility companies are interested in modeling the behavior \n        of the network in the presence of a fault (closed circuit breaker). The \n        governing equations, called the \"swing equations,\" are nonlinear \n        differential algebraic equations for the rotor angles of the generators \n        in the system. We developed new, more accurate algorithms for the swing \n        equations by solving a linear algebraic subproblem (complex-weighted least \n        squares) more accurately. Work on geometry in scientific computing continues. \n        Jonsson's thesis considers the problem of robust intersection of parametric \n        patches with rays and planes. This problem arises in geometric modeling \n        and mesh generation. Our results show that the problem can be solved accurately \n        by transforming it to a generalized eigenvalue computation using the theory \n        of resultants and other algebraic techniques.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four new students have begun to work with \n        me on other problems in scientific computing. We are looking at the following \n        topics: the effect of domain shape on solution to boundary value problems, \n        nonlinear diffusion equations, mesh generation for moving objects such \n        as a heart, and the protein model-fitting problem of x-ray crystallography.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>University Activities</b><br>\n        Member: Graduate admissions committee, Applied Mathematics.<br>\n        Graduate admissions committee, Computer Science. <br>\n        Faculty Senate. <br>\n        University Hearing Board.<br>\n        BOOM 2001 Vice-chair.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"><b>Professional Activities</b> \n        <br>\n        Editorial Boards: <i>Journal of Global Optimization; SIAM Journal Matrix \n        Analysis and Applications; SIAM<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Review; Math.

In particular, I investigate the \n        scalability problems that arise in these systems and try to provide solutions \n        in a form that is directly applicable to current practical problems. Currently \n        I am looking at the scalable cluster problems from three angles: foremost \n        I try to address cluster management scaling problems by developing a framework \n        for managing complete cluster farms with many different styles of cluster \n        computing present in the farm. Secondly, I am investigating some of the \n        issues that arise when providing support for the development of complex \n        cluster aware applications. Most recently, I have started to address some \n        of the more complex cluster system structuring issues such as meta-clusters \n        and geographical distributed clusters.<br>\n        I also remain active in the field of high-performance cluster communication. \n        In the past, I collaborated with Thorsten von Eicken on building high-performance \n        user-level network interfaces, which eventually resulted in the VIA industry \n        standard for user-level network interfaces. More recently, I have started \n        investigating the usage patterns of VIA based devices in large-scale clusters, \n        especially with respect to hot-spot control and high-performance flow \n        control.<br>\n        PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES<br>\n        Steering Committee: Usenix Windows Systems Symposium.<br>\n        Program Committee: Usenix 4th Windows Systems Symposium, IEEE International \n        Conference on Cluster Computing-Cluster 2000; 2001 IEEE Symposium on Applications \n        and the Internet; International SRDS Workshop on Dependable System Middleware \n        and Group Communication; Usenix 6th Conference on Object Oriented Tools \n        and Systems (Program Committee); IEEE 2nd Workshop on Internet Applications-WIAPP'01; \n        IFIP/ACM International Conference on Distributed Systems Platforms - Middleware \n        2001.<br>\n        Program Chair: Distributed Systems Track of 2001IEEE Symposium on Applications \n        and the Internet.<br>\n        General Chair: IEEE 2nd Workshop on Internet Applications-WIAPP'01.</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\">LECTURES<br>\n        Cluster Computing Made Easy: New Tools for Scalable Servers and Services.\" \n        Invited Lecture, Annual meeting of Advanced Cluster Computing Consortium \n        (June 2, 2000).</font></p>\n      <p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\">PUBLICATIONS<br>\n        \"Spinglass, Scalable and Secure Communication Tools for Mission-critical \n        Computing.\" Proceeedings of the 2001 DARPA Information Survivability \n        Conference and Exhibition - II (June, 2001).

We hope that the global \n        view will yield valuable insights about the nature and function of new \n        genes and will lead to the discovery of high-level properties and principles \n        in the protein space.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This interdisciplinary research is rooted \n        in two different disciplines: computer science and molecular biology. \n        Being on the borderline between the two disciplines, this study is related \n        to fields of intensive research in both. It incorporates study and development \n        of methods for metric embedding, unsupervised learning techniques, efficient \n        graph algorithms and parallel applications, and efficient database management. \n        On the computational biology side, it is involved with development of \n        new algorithms and approaches for protein comparison, statistical models \n        of protein families and study of the mapping from sequences to structures. \n        A great emphasis is on developing novel machine-learning based techniques, \n        both in the context of the study of the protein space and as general-purpose \n        tools.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My study so far has resulted in two large \n        databases that are being used by biologists to study new genes: ProtoMap: \n        this database and its interactive web sites (<a href=\"http://protomap.cornell.edu\">http://protomap.cornell.edu</a> \n        and <a href=\"http://protomap.stanford.edu\">http://protomap.stanford.edu</a>) \n        are based on a graph-theoretic approach for the large-scale organization \n        of protein sequences. The site offers an automatic hierarchical classification \n        of all known protein sequences. It is a useful resource for the analysis \n        of known as well as new protein sequences and for the study of relationships \n        between protein families.<br>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BioSpace: This database and its web sites \n        (<a href=\"http://biospace.cornell.edu\">http://biospace.cornell.edu</a> \n        and <a href=\"http://biospace.stanford.edu\">http://biospace.stanford.edu</a>) \n        are based on a new unified framework for sequence and structure analysis. \n        The result of this analysis is a preliminary global map of the protein \n        space.
