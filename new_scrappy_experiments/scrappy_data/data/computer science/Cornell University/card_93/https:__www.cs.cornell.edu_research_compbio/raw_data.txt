Her research is leading to the creation of the new field of computational sustainability, which develops and applies computational methods to enable a sustainable environment, economy and society.' research interests center on the development of algorithms for analyzing large scale gemomic data, and the application of these methods to study human genetic history, population and individual relationships, and the genetic basis of human disease. performs research research in the broad area of Biomedical Systems Biology with both high-throughput experimental (see ) methodologies, aiming to understand gene functions and their relationships within complex molecular networks and how perturbations to such systems may lead to various human diseases. The complexity of biological systems calls for building experimentally-verified computational models based on high-quality large-scale datasets, which is truly the future of biomedical research and the main theme of the lab."]}
