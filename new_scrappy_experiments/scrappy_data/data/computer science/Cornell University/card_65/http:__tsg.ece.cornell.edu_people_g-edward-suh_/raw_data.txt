I am interested in combining architectural techniques with low-level software to enhance various aspects of computing systems such as performance, energy-efficiency, and security. My current research projects focus on two major directions, one on building secure computing systems with verifiable security properties and the other on developing architecture and tools to enable efficient heterogeneous computing systems with minimal manual efforts.I was fortunate to work on multiple research projects, which had noticeable academic and practical impacts. I was named an IEEE Fellow for contributions to the development of secure hardware circuits and processors.My research has been supported by grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), the Office of Naval Research (ONR), the Army Research Office (ARO), the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)\u00a0as well as gifts from SRC, Intel, Xilinx, and SUN (now Oracle). The research grants include an NSF CAREER award, the AFOSR Young Faculty Program (YIP) award, and the ARO Young Investigator Program (YIP) award."]}
