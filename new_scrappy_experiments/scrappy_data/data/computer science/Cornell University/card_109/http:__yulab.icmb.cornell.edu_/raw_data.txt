We perform research in the broad area of ) methodologies, aiming to understand gene functions and their relationships within complex molecular networks and how perturbations to such systems may lead to various human diseases. The complexity of biological systems calls for building experimentally-verified computational models based on high-quality large-scale datasets, which is truly the future of biomedical research and the main theme of the lab. Our research is focused in five main areas:\n\t\t\tTo facilitate various research projects in the lab, we actively develop new algorithms and tools to analyze different genomic and proteomic datasets. In particular, we are devoted to implementing stand-alone and web-based tools that are easy to use by experimental biologists.\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWith the rapid advance of biotechnology, we strive to implement, improve, and develop cutting-edge high-throughput experimental methods with better accuracy and higher coverage.\n\t\t BISQUE is a locus and variant-specific conversion tool for human biological database identifiers.
