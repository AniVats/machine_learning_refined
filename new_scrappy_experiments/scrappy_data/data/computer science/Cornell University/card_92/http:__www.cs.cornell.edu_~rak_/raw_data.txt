Humans are uniquely capable of establishing ad-hoc teaming relationships, adapting to evolving circumstances, solving complex tasks, manipulating objects with dexterity, and acting competently under uncertainty. My research explores algorithmic techniques that imbue robots with these same competencies. Leveraging insights from psychology, sociology, and linguistics, I make robots that interact with humans through natural communication modalities such as natural language and gesture, so that they can be programmed without special training and can operate as peers with humans in the workplace and the home. Robots must be aware of their environment and responsive to changes within it. I often employ Ikea furniture assembly in the laboratory as a challenge problem to demonstrate techniques in planning, control, perception and human interaction."]}
