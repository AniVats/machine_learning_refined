I am a faculty member of the graduate fields of <a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu\">Computer Science</a> and <a href=\"http://www.systemseng.cornell.edu\">Systems Engineering</a>, and a faculty fellow of the <a href=\"https://www.atkinson.cornell.edu\">Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future</a>. I am part of Cornell\u2019s <a href=\"http://csl.cornell.edu\">Computer Systems Laboratory</a>.\n\n\nI have been very fortunate to work with some extraordinary people, and as a result my research has received a number of awards over the years; among them: two IEEE Micro Top Picks papers; a HPCA Best Paper award, as well as MICRO and HPCA Best Paper nominations; a NSF CAREER Award; two IBM Faculty Awards; and a Distinguished Educator Award by the University of Illinois\u2019 Computer Science Department (my graduate alma mater).\n\n\nOn the teaching side, I have been recognized with two Kenneth A. Goldman \u201971 and one Dorothy and Fred Chau MS\u201974 College of Engineering teaching awards; a Ruth and Joel Spira Award for Teaching Excellence; twice as the most influential college educator of a <a href=\"http://scl.cornell.edu/about-us/awards-funding/merrill-presidential-scholars-program\">Merrill Presidential Scholar</a>; and as the student-elected 2011 Tau Beta Pi Professor of the Year in the College of Engineering.\n\n\nI am an elected member of <a href=\"http://sigarch.org\">ACM SIGARCH</a>\u2018s Board of Directors (2019-2021). In 2017 I was Chair of the IEEE Computer Society\u2019s Transactions Operating Committee, in charge of overseeing all of the Society\u2019s journal publications; before that, I served as Editor in Chief of IEEE Computer Architecture Letters (2013-2016). I was Program Co-chair (with David August) of MICRO 2009, and Program Chair of HPCA 2016. I am General Co-chair (with Jos\u00e9 Duato) of ISCA 2020.\n\n\nI graduated in Computer Science &amp; Engineering (\u201cLicenciado en Inform\u00e1tica de Sistemas\u201d) in 1996 from the Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Valencia, and earned MS (1999) and Ph.D. (2002) degrees in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I received two national awards for academic excellence from Spain\u2019s Ministry of Education, and came to the United States on a four-year fellowship from the Bank of Spain, for which I am forever grateful. While a graduate student at UIUC, I was inducted into the Honor Society of Phi Kappa Phi.\n\n<h4>Research</h4>\n\nMy primary research interest is computer architecture: Microprocessors and computer systems; microarchitectures; multiprocessor and multicore architectures; caches and memory subsystems; embedded systems; buses and interconnects.\n\nI am currently the Assistant Director and Cornell PI of the DARPA/SRC <a href=\"https://www.ece.cornell.edu/news/engineers-hack-50-year-old-computing-problem-new-center\">Center for Research in Intelligent Storage and Processing in Memory (CRISP)</a>. I am also co-founder and part of the <a href=\"http://www.digitalagriculture.cornell.edu/our-people/initiative-leadership/\">Executive Committee</a> of <a href=\"http://www.digitalagriculture.cornell.edu\">Cornell\u2019s Initiative for Digital Agriculture (CIDA)</a>.\n\n\nI lead the <a href=\"http://m3.csl.cornell.edu/\">M<sup>3</sup> Architecture Research Group</a>, which is part of the <a href=\"http://csl.cornell.edu/\">Computer Systems Laboratory</a>, and comprises both graduate and undergraduate researchers."]}
