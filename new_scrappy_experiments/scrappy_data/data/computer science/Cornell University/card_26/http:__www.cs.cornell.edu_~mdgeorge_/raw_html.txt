I also received an MA in mathematics\n       from the University of Rochester in 2004.</p>\n\n    <p>My Ph.D. research focused on building decentralized distributed systems\n       that guarantee strong security properties.

A warranty is a time-limited\n          assertion about one or more distributed objects. These assertions\n          generalize optimistic concurrency control, improving throughput\n          because clients holding warranties need not communicate to verify the\n          warranty's assertion. Updates that might cause an active warranty to\n          become false are delayed until the warranty expires, trading write\n          latency for read latency. For workloads biased toward reads,\n          warranties improve scalability and system throughput. Warranties can\n          be expressed using language-level computations, and they integrate\n          harmoniously into the programming model as a form of memoization.\n          Experiments with some nontrivial programs demonstrate that warranties\n          enable high performance despite the simple programming model.</dd>\n\n      <dt><a href=\"pubs/mobile-oakland12.pdf\">Sharing Mobile Code Securely With Information Flow Control (Oakland 2012).</a></dt>\n      <dd>We introduce a new architecture for secure mobile code, with which\n          developers can securely use, publish, and share mobile code across\n          trust domains. This architecture enables new kinds of distributed\n          applications, and makes it easier to securely reuse and evolve code\n          from untrusted providers.</dd>\n\n      <dt><a href=\"pubs/fabric-sosp09.pdf\">Fabric: A Platform for Secure Distributed Computation and Storage (SOSP 2009).</a></dt>\n      <dd>Fabric is a new system and language for building secure distributed\n          information systems.
