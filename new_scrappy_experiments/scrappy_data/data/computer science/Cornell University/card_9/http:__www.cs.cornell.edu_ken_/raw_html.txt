Examples arise in smart highways and homes, smart power \n\tgrids. A recent interest at Cornell is digital agriculture, and we may drill \n\tdown on that just to have a focus on something concrete and novel.&nbsp;&nbsp; \n\tWe don't yet know if this class will be offered in fall 2020.</li>\n\t<li>Please note that both courses are open without any restrictions for \n\tgraduate students at the right level, but both require permission for \n\tstudents from outside CS.

As a result, our papers in this area date back to 1985. </p>\n<p>Some examples of mission-critical systems on which my software was used in \nthe past include the New York Stock Exchange and Swiss Exchange, the French Air \nTraffic Control system, the AEGIS warship and a wide range of applications in \nsettings like factory process control and telephony. In fact, every stock quote \nor trade on the NYSE from 1995 until early 2006 was reported to the overhead \ntrading consoles through software I personally implemented - a cool (but also \nscary) image, for me at least! During the ten years this system was running, \nmany computers crashed during the trading day, and many network problems have \noccurred - but the design we developed and implemented has managed to \nreconfigure itself automatically and kept the overall system up, without \nexception. They didn't have a single trading disruption during the entire \nperiod. As far as I know, the other organizations listed above have similar \nstories to report. </p>\n<p>Today, these kinds of ideas are gaining \"mainstream\" status. For example, \nIBM's Websphere 6.0 product includes a multicast layer used to replicate data \nand other runtime state for high-availability web service applications and web \nsites. Although IBM developed its own implementation of this technology, we've \nbeen told by the developers that the architecture was based on Cornell's Horus \nand Ensemble systems, described more fully below. The CORBA architecture \nincludes a fault-tolerance mechanism based on some of the same ideas. And we've \nalso worked with Microsoft on the technology at the core of the next generation \nof that company's clustering product. So, you'll find Cornell's research not \njust on these web pages, but also on web sites worldwide and in some of the \nworld's most ambitious data centers and high availability computing systems. </p>\n<p>In fact we still have very active dialogs with many of these companies: \nCisco, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Amazon, and others. An example of a more recent \ndialog is this: a few years ago worked with Cisco to invent a new continuous \navailability option for their core Internet routers, the CRS-1 series. You can \nread about this work\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/quicksilver/public_pdfs/Routers.pdf\">\nhere</a>. </p>\n<p>My group often works with vendors and industry researchers. We maintain a \nvery active dialog with the US government and military on research challenges \nemerging from a future generation communication systems now being planned by \norganizations like the Air Force and the Navy. We've even worked on new ways of \ncontrolling the electric power grid, but not in time to head off the big \nblackout in 2003! Looking to the future, we are focused on needs arising in \nfinancial systems, large-scale military systems, and even health-care networks. \n(In this connection, I should perhaps mention that although we do get research \nsupport from the government and the US military, none of our research is \nclassified or even sensitive, and all of it focuses on widely used commercial \nstandards and platforms. Most of our software is released for free, under open \nsource licenses.) </p>\n<p>I'm just one of many members of a group in this area at Cornell. My closest \ncolleagues and co-leaders of the group are Robbert van Renesse and Hakim \nWeatherspoon. But the systems group is very strong and broad right now, and the \nthree of us have great relationships and collaborations with many other systems \nfaculty here at Cornell (both in the systems area within CS, but also folks in \nECE where we have great ties, MAE, IS, and down in New York City, where a few \nfaculty are members of our fast-growing New York City Technology \"outpost\" on \nRoosveldt Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Four generations of reliable distributed systems research!</strong> \nOverall, our group has developed three generations of technology and is now \nworking on a fourth generation system: The Isis Toolkit, developed mostly during \n1987-1993, the Horus system, developed starting in 1990 until around 1995, the \nEnsemble system, 1995-1999. Right now we're developing a number of new systems \nincluding Isis2, Gradient, and the reliable TCP solution mentioned above, and \nworking with others to integrate those solutions into settings where \nreliability, security, consistency and scalability are make-or-break \nrequirements. Older Research web pages:\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/quicksilver/\">Live Objects, \nQuicksilver, Maelstrom, Ricochet and Tempest</a> projects\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/Ensemble/\">Ensemble</a> project\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/HORUS/\">Horus</a> project\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/Isis/\">Isis Toolkit</a> (really \nold stuff!&nbsp; This is from the very first version of Isis). A collection of papers \non Isis, edited by myself with Robbert van Renesse, may still be available -- it \nwas called Reliable Distributed Computing with the Isis Toolkit and was in the \nIEEE Press Computer Science series. </p>\n<p><strong>Graduate Studies in Computer Science at Cornell: </strong>At this \ntime of the year, we get large numbers of inquiries about our PhD program. I \nwant to recommend that people interested in the program not contact faculty \nmembers like me directly with routine questions like \"can your research group \nfund me\". </p>\n<p>As you'll see from the web page, Cornell does admissions by means of a \ncommittee, so individual faculty members don't normally play a role. This is \ndifferent from many other schools -- I realize that at many places, each faculty \nmember admits people into her/his own group. But at Cornell, we admit you first, \nthen you come here, and then you affiliate with a research group after a while. \nFunding is absolutely guaranteed for people in the MS/PhD program during the \nwhole time they are at Cornell. On the other hand, students in the MEng program \ngenerally need to pay their own way. </p>\n<p>Obviously, some people have more direct, specific questions, and there is no \nproblem sending those to me or to anyone else. But as for the generic \"can I \njoin your research group?\" the answer is that while I welcome people into the \ngroup if they demonstrate good ideas and talent in my area, until you are here \nand take my graduate course and spend time talking with me and my colleagues, \nhow can we know if the match is good? And most such inquiries are from people \nwho haven't yet figured out quite how many good projects are underway at \nCornell. Perhaps, on arrival, you'll take Andrew Myer's course in language based \nsecurity and will realize this is your passion. So at Cornell, we urge you to \ntake time to find out what areas we cover and who is here, to take some courses, \nand only then affiliate with a research group. But please knock on my door any \ntime you like! I'm more than happy to talk to any student in the department \nabout anything we're doing here! </p>\n<p><strong>Photo credit: Dave Burbank</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n</body></html>"
