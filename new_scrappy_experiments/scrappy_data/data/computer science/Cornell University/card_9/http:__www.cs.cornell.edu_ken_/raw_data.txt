Examples arise in smart highways and homes, smart power \n\tgrids. A recent interest at Cornell is digital agriculture, and we may drill \n\tdown on that just to have a focus on something concrete and novel.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\tWe don't yet know if this class will be offered in fall 2020.Please note that both courses are open without any restrictions for \n\tgraduate students at the right level, but both require permission for \n\tstudents from outside CS. Just reach out by email if you need permission and \n\twe can talk about your background and whether you could do well in these \n\tclasses. Don't just assume you won't be allowed to enroll.", "An updated version of a talk I gave at SmartMemory on our new RDMA \n\tresearch (Derecho and the Freeze Frame File System) can be found\n\tRobbert van Renesse and me discussing how we got into this area of \n\tresearch: ", "Today, these kinds of ideas are gaining \"mainstream\" status. For example, \nIBM's Websphere 6.0 product includes a multicast layer used to replicate data \nand other runtime state for high-availability web service applications and web \nsites. Although IBM developed its own implementation of this technology, we've \nbeen told by the developers that the architecture was based on Cornell's Horus \nand Ensemble systems, described more fully below. The CORBA architecture \nincludes a fault-tolerance mechanism based on some of the same ideas. And we've \nalso worked with Microsoft on the technology at the core of the next generation \nof that company's clustering product. So, you'll find Cornell's research not \njust on these web pages, but also on web sites worldwide and in some of the \nworld's most ambitious data centers and high availability computing systems. ", "My group often works with vendors and industry researchers. We maintain a \nvery active dialog with the US government and military on research challenges \nemerging from a future generation communication systems now being planned by \norganizations like the Air Force and the Navy. We've even worked on new ways of \ncontrolling the electric power grid, but not in time to head off the big \nblackout in 2003! Looking to the future, we are focused on needs arising in \nfinancial systems, large-scale military systems, and even health-care networks. \n(In this connection, I should perhaps mention that although we do get research \nsupport from the government and the US military, none of our research is \nclassified or even sensitive, and all of it focuses on widely used commercial \nstandards and platforms. Most of our software is released for free, under open \nsource licenses.) ", "Four generations of reliable distributed systems research!", "Obviously, some people have more direct, specific questions, and there is no \nproblem sending those to me or to anyone else. But as for the generic \"can I \njoin your research group?\" the answer is that while I welcome people into the \ngroup if they demonstrate good ideas and talent in my area, until you are here \nand take my graduate course and spend time talking with me and my colleagues, \nhow can we know if the match is good? And most such inquiries are from people \nwho haven't yet figured out quite how many good projects are underway at \nCornell. Perhaps, on arrival, you'll take Andrew Myer's course in language based \nsecurity and will realize this is your passion. So at Cornell, we urge you to \ntake time to find out what areas we cover and who is here, to take some courses, \nand only then affiliate with a research group. But please knock on my door any \ntime you like! I'm more than happy to talk to any student in the department \nabout anything we're doing here! "]}
