Current research topics include the application of game theory and statistical decision theory for designing robust fixed-geometry confidence regions for multivariate location parameters, and algorithms for robust multisensor fusion and set-valued state estimation with performance guarantees. Max also works with applications of confidence sets for cooperative and noncooperative mobile robots.Data integration and pattern-finding in biological sequence with TESS's Annotation Grammar and Extraction Language (AnGEL)"]}
