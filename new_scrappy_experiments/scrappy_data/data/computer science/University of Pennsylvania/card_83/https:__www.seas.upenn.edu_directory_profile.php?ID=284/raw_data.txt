He is primarily engaged in researching RF and digital integrated circuits for microwave and millimeter-wave communication systems, radar systems, and imaging systems. In his work, Tom is interested in finding creative ways to yield higher RF output power from power amplifiers made in silicon-based IC technologies at millimeter-wave frequencies, through innovative circuit design, while still achieving high linearity, efficiency, and gain."]}
