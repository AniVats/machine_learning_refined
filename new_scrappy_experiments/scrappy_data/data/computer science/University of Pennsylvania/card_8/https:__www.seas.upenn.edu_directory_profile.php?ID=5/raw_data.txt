His present interests extend those topics to involve interdisciplinary digital humanities: the real-time graphics simulation of human presence and activities from ancient cultures in reconstructed virtual environments. He has supervised or co-supervised 62 PhD students, many of whom have become academics or researchers in the movie visual effects and game industries.  He is the founding Director of the SIG Center for Computer Graphics, the Center for Human Modeling and Simulation, and the ViDi Center for Digital Visualization at Penn. He is also the founder and Director of the Digital Media Design undergraduate Engineering degree within Computer and Information Science in SEAS.  \n<strong>Member of:</strong><ul> <a href=\"http://cg.cis.upenn.edu/\">SIG Center for Computer Graphics</a> <a href=\"http://cg.cis.upenn.edu/vidi.html\">Center for Digital Visualization (ViDi)</a> \n<div style=\"margin-top:0\">\n<strong>Education:</strong> <br/>PhD Computer Science 1975 - University of Toronto <br/>   MSc Mathematics 1971 - University of Toronto <br/>  BA  College of Creative Studies 1970 - University of California at Santa Barbara<br/>\n\n <strong><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e8e5qGcAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">Recent Publications</a></strong>\n\n</ul>\n<hr style=\"clear: left; margin: 1em 0em 1.5em 0em;\"/>\n<div style=\"margin: 3em 0;\"><a href=\"departments.php\" style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Return to Directory</a>\n\n\n<!-- Footer -->\n<div id=\"footer-wrapper\">\n<footer class=\"container\" id=\"footer\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"12u\">\n<div id=\"copyright\">\n<ul class=\"menu\">\n\u00a9 <a href=\"http://www.seas.upenn.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Penn Engineering</a>\nDesign: <a href=\"http://html5up.net\">HTML5 UP</a>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n</footer>"]}
