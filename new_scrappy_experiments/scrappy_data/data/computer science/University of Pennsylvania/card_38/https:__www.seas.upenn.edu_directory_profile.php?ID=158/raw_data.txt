In particular, his group is interested in the architecture of the control processes, investigating the kind of control logic used, and how that architecture modulates evolutionary dynamics.  Most of Junhyong's work involves mammalian neurons and yeasts as model systems. His group uses both experimental and theoretical approaches to these problems.  Current projects include localization of mRNA neurons, cell remodeling, evolution of the transciptome in yeast, evolution of functional RNAs, and reconstructing the Tree of Life."]}
