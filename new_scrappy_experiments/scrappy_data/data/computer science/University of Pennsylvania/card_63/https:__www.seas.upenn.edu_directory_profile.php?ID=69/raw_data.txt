His research group focuses on developing analysis and design algorithms and tools for hybrid systems, which merge control systems with computing systems. Their methods have been used in developing algorithms for coordinated motion of fleets of unmanned aerial vehicles and multi-robot systems, analyzing the safety of next generation medical devices, and understanding the macroscopic behavior of biological networks."]}
