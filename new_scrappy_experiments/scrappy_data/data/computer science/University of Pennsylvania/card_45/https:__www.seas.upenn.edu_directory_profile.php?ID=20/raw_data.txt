His research addresses challenges in the perception of motion and space, such as the geometric design of cameras, and the interplay of geometry and appearance in perception tasks.  Kostas's research gives solutions to perceptual tasks such as panoramic vision, localization, perception of self-motion, large-scale mapping, visual location recognition, 3-D object recognition, and vision-based flocking. Applications of his research involve robot navigation, tele-immersion, and image and shape retrieval."]}
