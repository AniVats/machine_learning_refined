He is developing network architectures for new services and applications, such as the Terabit Edge Research Activity (TERA), which is focused on the coupling between parallel processing and parallelism in transmission systems, and implications for host software and network control. Jonathan is also working on Zodiac, an intrinsically assurable mobile ad-hoc network, where many challenges ensue as router and host become indistinguishable, and Dynamic Trust Management (DTM), which is focused on \"situation-aware\" authorizations for privileged actions, such as emergency situations."]}
