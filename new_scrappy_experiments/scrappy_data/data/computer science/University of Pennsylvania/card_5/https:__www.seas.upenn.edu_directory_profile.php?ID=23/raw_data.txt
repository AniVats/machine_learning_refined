Andre is concerned with effective nanoscale design, which requires a rethinking of computer organization, including conventional abstraction layers. In his work, Andre and his colleagues explore how to harness emerging nanoscale building blocks, such as nanowires, CNTs, and molecules for computation, and how to address the physical challenges they present, including high defect and fault rates, parameter variation, lifetime variability, and statistical assembly."]}
