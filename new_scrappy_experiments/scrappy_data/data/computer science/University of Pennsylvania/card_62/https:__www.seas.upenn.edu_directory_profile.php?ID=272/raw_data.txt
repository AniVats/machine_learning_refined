Recently, he has been working on developing algorithms for ensuring correctness of machine learning models. These models are increasingly used in real world systems where failures can be catastrophic, such as autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, and legal decision making.\n<strong>Member of:</strong><ul> <a href=\"https://precise.seas.upenn.edu/\">Embedded Computing and Integrated Systems (PRECISE)</a> \n<div style=\"margin-top:0\">\n<strong>Education:</strong> <br/>Dr. Bastani received his A.B. in Mathematics from Harvard University.
