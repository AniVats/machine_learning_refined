He integrates problems from these areas with methods from theoretical computer science and related disciplines. While the majority of Michael's work is mathematical in nature, he has also participated in a variety of systems and experimental work, including spoken dialogue systems, software agents, and most recently, human-subject experiments in strategic and economic interaction."]}
