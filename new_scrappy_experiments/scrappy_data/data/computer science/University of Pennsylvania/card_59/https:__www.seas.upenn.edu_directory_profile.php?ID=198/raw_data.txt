She is particularly interested in problems where mathematical or algorithmic tools can provide insight on the security or real-world systems; most recently, this has meant discovering and studying widespread random number generation vulnerabilities. Current areas of interest include network security, privacy, cryptanalysis, computational number theory, lattices, coding theory, and implications for public policy."]}
