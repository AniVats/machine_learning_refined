His work has been critical to the development of game, auction and pricing theory - for example, the keyword auctions central to online search engines - and spans such areas as operations research, market systems and optimal pricing mechanisms. In addition to more than 70 articles and working papers, he is co-author of \"Principles of Pricing\" (Cambridge University Press, 2012) and author of \"Mechanism Design\" (Cambridge University Press, 2011) and \"Advanced Mathematical Economics\" (Routledge, 2004).
