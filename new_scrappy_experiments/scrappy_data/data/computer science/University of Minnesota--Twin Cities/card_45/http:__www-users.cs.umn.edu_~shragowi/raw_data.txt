This work requires application of\nvariety of mathematical techniques ranging from solving of systems of partial differential equations to advanced optimization techniques and soft computing.\nCAD systems belong to the category of the largest and the most complex software systems. Final products of our research very often have a form of  very large computer programs.\nWe also are working on application of fuzzy logic for solving of CAD problems. Fuzzy logic and other soft computing techniques allow to address the problems which are poorly handled by traditional mathematical methods.\nOur research also includes high level synthesis and other aspects of design automation.\nBecause many design problems are combinatorial in nature we are actively researching algorithms for combinatorial optimization,\nspecifically in the areas with the direct applications in CAD."]}
