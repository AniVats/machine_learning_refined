He has also been a member of the Computer Science faculty at the University of Oregon and a Member of Technical Staff at Bell Telephone Laboratories.  Meyer received his Bachelors Degree from the University of Michigan, his Masters Degree from Stanford University, and his PhD Degree from Cornell University. His research interests include the synthesis of color and appearance in computer graphic pictures, perceptual issues related to synthetic image generation, and color reproduction and color selection for the human-computer interface.Professor Meyer\u2019s research centers around the role of color in computer graphics, with a focus on the accurate and efficient reproduction of color in synthetic images. Three primary questions drive his research: How can knowledge of color perception and processing in the human visual system be used to improve computer-based color synthesis? How can natural phenomena that influence color, such as refraction and scattering, be simulated in synthetic images?  How can computer graphics provide the same computer aided design tools to designers of color appearance materials that the designers of mechanical parts have had for over forty years? The exploration of these questions leads to improvements in techniques used to create computer graphic imagery.\n\n      </p>\n      \n    </div>\n    <div id=\"right\">\n      \n      <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/meyer.jpg\">\n      <p></p>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"footerline\"></div>\n  </div>\n  <div id=\"footer\">Copyright \u00a9 2011 All rights reserved</div>\n</div>\n\n\n</body></html>"
