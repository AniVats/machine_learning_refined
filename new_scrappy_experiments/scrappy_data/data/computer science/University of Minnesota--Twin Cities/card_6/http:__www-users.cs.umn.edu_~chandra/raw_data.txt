Much of my focus in recent years has been on designing and optimizing systems for data-driven computing in the cloud and at the edge, especially for data generated at the edge of the network (near the users). This focus has involved research in geo-distributed data analytics, social analytics, and mobile and IoT data analytics.\n\t    \nMy research has focused on resource management and performance in\ndistributed systems, such as Clouds, Data centers, Grids, and Mobile platforms,\nwith the goal of achieving higher reliability,\nscalability, and manageability. \nMuch of my focus in recent years has been on designing and optimizing systems for\ndata-driven computing:\ngeo-distributed data analytics,\nsocial analytics,\ninteractions of mobile computing (and now IoT) with the cloud, \nand data analytics in the cloud.\n"]}
