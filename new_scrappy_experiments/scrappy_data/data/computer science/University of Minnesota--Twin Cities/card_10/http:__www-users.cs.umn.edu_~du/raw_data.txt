His research in intelligent storage systems focus on new \n  storage technologies/architectures, that can handle semantic data and adaptive to long-term data preservation, and efficient \n  power management for data centers. His research in sensor/vehicular networks and cyber physical systems focuses on \n  vehicle-to-vehicle communications, future intelligent transportation systems, next generation air-transportation systems \n  and security and privacy issues for cyber physical systems. His group is currently focusing on research issues on hyperconverging \n  (seamless integrating compute, storage and network in a single IT infrastructure and using AI and machine learning approaches of \n  solving challenging systems management issues.\n"]}
