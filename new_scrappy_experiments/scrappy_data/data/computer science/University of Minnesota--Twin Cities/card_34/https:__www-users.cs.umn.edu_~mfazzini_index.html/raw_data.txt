I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology. My research interests lie primarily in the area of software engineering, with emphasis on techniques for improving software quality. The central theme of my research is the development of techniques for software testing and maintenance. I am also interested in defining techniques for investigating software attacks and securing software.\n          <li>\n                <b>[Press] School of Computer Science Researchers Make Investigating Multi-host Attacks Easier</b><br/>August 2018</br>Georgia Institute of Technology<br/><a href=\"https://www.cc.gatech.edu/news/610376/school-computer-science-researchers-make-investigating-multi-host-attacks-easier\">Link</a>\n            </li><li>\n                <b>[Press] Georgia Tech Researchers Create DiffDroid to Detect Android App Inconsistencies</b><br/>November 2017<br/>Georgia Institute of Technology<br/><a href=\"https://www.cc.gatech.edu/news/599276/georgia-tech-researchers-create-diffdroid-detect-android-app-inconsistencies\">Link</a>\n            </li><li>\n                <b>[Press] \"Instant Replay\" for Computer Systems Shows Cyber Attack Details</b><br/>October 2017</br>Association of American Universities<br/><a href=\"https://www.aau.edu/research-scholarship/featured-research-topics/instant-replay-computer-systems-shows-cyber-attack\">Link</a>\n            </li>"]}
