Of special interest are declarative\nspecifications of languages and language tools.  More information is\navailable on my group's web page: <a href=\"http://melt.cs.umn.edu\">Minnesota Extensible Language\nTools</a>.  \n\nIn investigating extensible languages and compilers we have developed\ntwo systems for the design and implementation of languages.\n<ul>\n\n The first is Silver, an attribute grammar specification language\n(and its supporting tools) that allows for the highly-modular\nspecification of languages.  \n\n The second is Copper, an integrated parser and context-aware\nscanner generator.  Context aware scanners use information from the\nparser to be more discriminating in the tokens they return.  This\noften simplifies the grammar as tokens don't need to be overloaded and\nused in multiple contexts.  This turns out to be quite useful in\nextensible language specification.\n\n</ul>\n\n More information about Silver and Copper, including papers,\ndocumentation, and downloads can be found on the <a href=\"http://melt.cs.umn.edu/silver/\">Silver web page</a> and the\n<a href=\"http://melt.cs.umn.edu/copper/\">Copper web page</a>.\n\n<b>Publications</b> can be found <a href=\"pubs.html\">here</a>.\n\n<h2>Research Opportunities</h2>\nI am always looking for motivated students with an interest in\nprogramming languages.  If you are interested in the mix of\ntheoretical and practical work that often occurs in research in\nprogramming languages then please get in contact with me."]}
