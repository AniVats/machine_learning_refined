This means looking into improving a robot's perception about people, their intentions and/or actions, engaging in dialog, as well as the environment. Perceiving the world robustly, particularly under changing and degraded conditions is an open challenge; \u00a0my research interest extends into multi-modal sensory perception. My past research has been heavily influenced by making robots work with humans in unstructured environments, particularly underwater, and current and work involves field robots in the air, water and outdoor, all-terrain platforms.For specific information about my research and teaching, please browse through the links or visit the "]}
