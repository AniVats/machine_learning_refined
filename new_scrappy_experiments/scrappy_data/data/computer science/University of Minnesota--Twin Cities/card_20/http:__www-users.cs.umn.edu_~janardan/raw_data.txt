My\nresearch here encompasses algorithm and data\nstructure design and analysis, software development, and deployment of\nsolutions into applications.\nApplication areas of current interest include computer-aided\ndesign and manufacture, biomedical simulation and modeling, geometric\ncomputing under uncertainty, and \nspatial query processing.\nTo get a flavor for some of \nthis, you can check out some of my work on layered\nmanufacturing (a.k.a. 3D-printing) ", "@cs.umn.edu) if you would like more\ninformation or copies of my other papers, or are interested in\ncollaborating on research.\n"]}
