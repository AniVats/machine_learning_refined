Kumar received the B.E. degree in Electronics &amp; Communication Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee (formerly, University of Roorkee), India, in 1977, the M.E. degree in Electronics Engineering from Philips International Institute, Eindhoven, Netherlands, in 1979, and the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from University of Maryland, College Park, in 1982.  He also served as the Head of the Computer Science and Engineering Department from 2005 to 2015 and the Director of Army High Performance Computing Research Center (AHPCRC) from 1998 to 2005.  \n<br/>\n\nKumar's research spans data mining, high-performance computing, and their applications in Climate/Ecosystems and health care.  His research has resulted in the development of the concept of isoefficiency metric for evaluating the scalability of parallel algorithms, as well as highly efficient parallel algorithms and software for sparse matrix factorization (PSPASES) and graph partitioning (METIS, ParMetis, hMetis).  He has authored over 300 research articles, and has coedited or coauthored 10 books including two text books ``Introduction to Parallel Computing'' and ``Introduction to Data Mining'', that are used world-wide and have been translated into many languages.  \nKumar's current major research focus is on bringing the power of big data and machine learning to understand the impact of human induced changes on the Earth and its environment.  Kumar served as the Lead PI of a 5-year, $10 Million project, </a>", "</a>"]}
