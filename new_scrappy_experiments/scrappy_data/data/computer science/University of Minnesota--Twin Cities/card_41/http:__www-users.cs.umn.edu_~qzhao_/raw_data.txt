In particular, I am interested in providing theoretical foundations and computational innovations in computer vision, inventing new machine learning methods inspired by many AI problems including vision, brain sciences, and medical sciences, and building intelligent systems that leverage both artificial and human intelligence. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe new book I edited is out! -- it provides an overview of vision from various perspectives, ranging from neuroscience to cognition, and from computational principles to engineering. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "Copyright \u00a9 2018 - All Rights Reserved - \n\t\t\t\t\tUMN VIP\n"]}
