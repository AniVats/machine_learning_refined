I am also interested in logic, especially as it\nunderlies our understanding of programming formalisms and as it\ninforms our construction of general reasoning systems. \n\n</a><p><a name=\"research\">\nI have developed a higher-order logic programming language called </a><a href=\"http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Dale.Miller/lProlog/\">\u03bbProlog</a>\nin collaboration with Dale Miller.\nThis language pioneered systematic support for\n<i>higher-order abstract syntax</i>, a new way of viewing\nthe syntactic structure of objects such as programs, formulas, proofs\nand types that occur in many symbol processing tasks. \nI have subsequently led a research project that has developed the \n<a href=\"http://teyjus.cs.umn.edu\">Teyjus</a> system that is an\nefficient implementation of \u03bbProlog. Version 2 of this system\nwas released in April 2008 and runs on varied architectures and under\nall the major operating systems. \n\n</p><p>\nThe \u03bbProlog language provides as a mechanism for specifying\nsystems that can be conveniently conceptualized via a collection of\ninference rules operating on the syntax of objects. I am interested\nalso in reasoning about the  properties of such systems through their\nspecifications. The <a href=\"http://slimmer.gforge.inria.fr/\">SLIMMER</a> project initiated\nthe work of my group in this direction and resulted in the\n<a href=\"http://slimmer.gforge.inria.fr/bedwyr/\">Bedwyr</a>\ntheorem-prover. We have subsequently started working on developing\nmore powerful reasoning\ncapabilities. The <a href=\"http://abella.cs.umn.edu\">Abella</a> system\nembodies some of the foundational work we have done on designing\nlogics to support such reasoning. \n\n</p><p>\nMy research also spans theoretical developments that are useful\nrelative to programming languages and logical frameworks. In the past,\nsuch work has spanned proof theory and logic, lambda calculus\nnotations and their properties and unification procedures. \n\n</p><p></p><hr><p>\n<a name=\"grad\">\n</a></p><h2><a name=\"grad\">Research Opportunities for Students</a></h2><a name=\"grad\">\n\n\nIf you are a student at the University of Minnesota, you enjoy\nintrospecting on programs and programming, you like the challenge of\nthinking of theoretical issues and you are thrilled by the idea of\ntesting out your thinking by building systems, do get in touch with me\nbecause we will sure have some common interests. This is not a message\nonly to graduate students: I especially like working with motivated\nand interested undergraduates so you are welcome as well. To\nparticipate effectively in the research of my group, you will, of\ncourse, need to have an adequate background to complement your\ninclination. I can help you figure out how to go about doing this;\ntypically you should think of doing the <i>Programming Languages</i>\nand the <i>Compilers</i> courses that we offer in the department and\nyou should also have done or should plan on doing a logic course or\na course on computability theory. \n<p>\nA note for prospective graduate students: I will be happy to exchange\nmail about research interests and possibilities. However, I typically\ndo not respond to requests for funding that come without any prior\ncontext. More importantly, you would be wasting your time and mine if\nyou try to indulge in such a discussion. Our department has an\nadmissions committee that must make the first decisions and research\nfunding is relevant only after a clear connection in interests has\nbeen established.\n\n\n</p><p></p><hr></a><p><a name=\"grad\">\n</a><a name=\"seminar\">\n</a></p><h2><a name=\"seminar\"> Programming Languages Seminar</a></h2><a name=\"seminar\">\n\nA group of interested students and faculty members meet for about an\nhour and a half each week to discuss a research paper or two that we\nhave collectively decided to read a couple of weeks before. We\ntypically decide on whether or not we are going to do this and also\nthe time for the meeting at the beginning of the semester so you\nshould get in touch with one of the Programming Languages and Software\nEngineering faculty early enough if you are interested. The cost of\nparticipation is small: you mainly have to agree to lead the\ndiscussion of a paper every now and then. The benefits of\nparticipation are substantial: you learn about some of the research\ntrends in the programming languages area, you get to hone your skills\nfor reading such papers in a friendly and encouraging setting, you get\nto interact with a group of nice people and you partake of the goodies\nsomeone brings each week to the meeting.\n\n<p></p><hr></a><p><a name=\"seminar\">\n</a><a name=\"conferences\">\n</a></p><h2><a name=\"conferences\">Conference Program Committees</a></h2><a name=\"conferences\">\n</a><ul><a name=\"conferences\">\n</a><li><a name=\"conferences\"></a><a href=\"http://www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/lics/lics09/\">IEEE Symposium on\n    Logic in Computer Science (2009)</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"http://workshops.inf.ed.ac.uk/lfmtp/\">International\n    Workshop on Logical Frameworks and Meta-languages: Theory and\n    Practice (2009)</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"http://www.ist.unomaha.edu/iclp2009/\">International\n    Conference on Logic Programming (2009)</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/ppdp09/\">International\n    ACM/SIGPLAN Conference on Principles and Practice of Declarative\n    Programming</a> \n</li></ul>\n\n<p></p><hr><p>\n<a name=\"editorial\">\n</a></p><h2><a name=\"editorial\">Editorial and Related Duties</a></h2><a name=\"editorial\">\n</a><ul><a name=\"editorial\">\n</a><li><a name=\"editorial\"></a><a href=\"http://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/~dtai/projects/ALP//TPLP/\">Theory\nand Practice of Logic Programming</a>, Member of the Advisory\nBoard.
