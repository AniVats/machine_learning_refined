The group\u2019s research focused on solutions to visual learning, which significantly reduces the time to program intelligent agents. These solutions involve Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and AI algorithms to interpret peoples\u2019 actions and the scene\u2019s geometry. The research draws on the strengths of the symbolic approach (classical AI), connectionism (deep learning), and dynamicism (control theory).<em><br/></em>\n<strong><a href=\"http://angle.lab.asu.edu/\">Advancing Next Generation Learning Environments (ANGLE)</a><br/></strong><em>Robert K.
