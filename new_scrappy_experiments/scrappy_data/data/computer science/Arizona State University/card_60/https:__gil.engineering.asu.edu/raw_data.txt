My goal is to develop and use technologies for improving robot-robot and human-robot teamwork. \u00a0The key to effective coordination is information exchange. \u00a0So my research looks at ways that use wireless signals to improve communication in multi-robot teams, enhance situational awareness, and secure core multi-agent algorithms. My work has also studied the potential of using brain signals for information exchange in human-robot teams. \u00a0I am interested in applications of my research to positioning systems indoors, human-robot collaboration, and making robot-robot teams robust and secure against cybersecurity threats.Read about our research on\u00a0security for multi-robot systems from MIT NewsView our research in:As one of the vision leads for this new testbed I am proud to say that ASU now has one of the largest drone research testbeds in academia! \u00a0See the Congratulations to our REACT Lab members Paul Vohs, Thomas Wheeler, and Maxwell Flanagan whose research proposals were selected for FURI 2018/2019!My research focuses on intuitive human-robot communication using the human brain signals acquired via EEG."]}
