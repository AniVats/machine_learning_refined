She holds a Research Scientist position with Facebook\u2019s AI Infrastructure Research. She is a senior member of both ACM and IEEE.\nProf. Wu works in the area of Computer and System Architectures. In particular, her research focuses on high-performance and energy-efficient computer architecture through hardware heterogeneity, energy harvesting techniques for emerging computing devices, temperature and energy management for portable electronics. More recently, her research has pivoted into designing systems for machine learning. She is the leading author of \u201cMachine Learning at Facebook: Understanding Inference at the Edge\u201d which presents unique design challenges faced when deploying machine learning solutions at scale to the edge, from over billions of smartphones in the wild to Facebook\u2019s virtual reality platforms. She is the recipient of the 2018 IEEE ITHERM Best Paper Award, the 2017 NSF CAREER Award, the 2017 IEEE Young Engineer of the Year Award, the 2014 IEEE Best of Computer Architecture Letter Award, the 2013 Science Foundation Arizona Bisgrove Early Career Scholarship, and the 2011-12 Intel Ph.D. Fellowship. Her research has been supported by both industry sources and the National Science Foundation.\nShe currently serves on the Steering Committee of the IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software and is the Program Chair for the 2018 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization. She is also co-chairing the MLPerf Edge Inference WG. She served on\u00a0the Executive Committee of the IEEE Technical Committee on Computer Architecture (TCCA) 2017-18. Prof. Wu received her M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from Princeton University. She completed a B.Sc. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Cornell University."]}
