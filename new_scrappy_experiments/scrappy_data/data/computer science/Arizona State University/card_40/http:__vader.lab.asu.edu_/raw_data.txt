Research in the lab focuses on foundations of spatial temporal analysis, interactive machine learning, and explainable AI. Ongoing research at the VADER Lab include exploring how decision support systems can enhance modeling, analysis and policy making at the food-energy-water nexus, how visual analytics can explain vulnerabilities in machine learning models, and applications of spatiotemporal analysis ranging from crime predictions to geo-referenced text analysis to economic geography."]}
