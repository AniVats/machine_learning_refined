My process side work focuses on ways\nto capture, share, and reuse interface design knowledge.\nMy applications, generally developed for mobile devices\n(tablets, smartwatches, handhelds, and mobile phones),\nfocus on fields in which appropriate notifications\nhave great potential value--health and wellness,\nassistive technologies, hiking and biking,\nwork-order systems, and educational situations.\n</p><p>\nI lead Virginia Tech's\n<b><a href=\"http://technologyonthetrail.wordpress.com\">Technology on the Trail</a></b>\ninitiative, that is investigating ways that technology is used in\nhiking, biking, walking, and other outdoor travel-related settings.\nWe seek to balance the benefits of inserting technology\ninto hiking and outdoor settings\nwith the impact on individuals and their relationships with others.\nMuch of our work has examined existing technologies and how they have\nimpacted our experiences and relationships in the outdoors.\nWe also seek partnerships with scientists and outdoor enthusiasts\nwho are interested in ways that technology can help them;\ncurrent partnerships are investigating poison ivy emergence and spread,\nwater quality monitoring, campsite sustainability, and birding.\n</p><p>\nPotential collaborators are encouraged to send me email\nor, if you are local, come by during my office hours\nwhich I hold as part of our weekly\n<a href=\"https://crowd.cs.vt.edu/hacksnack/\">Hack and Snack</a> gathering.\nI'm always interested in working on research projects\nwith motivated students at all levels:\nundergrad, Masters, Ph.D.\nI co-founded and co-direct the <a href=\"http://vturcs.cs.vt.edu/\">VTURCS</a>\nendergraduate research program\nto encourage undergrads to become involved in research,\nand, for undergraduate students wanting to work with me,\nI sponsor several projects through the program.\nI also teach Senior Capstone classes and grad special topics classes\non a rotating set of themes.\n</p><p>\nVisit my <a href=\"http://research.cs.vt.edu/ns/\">research group page</a>\nfor more details about the research directions of my students and me,\nand view a list of my <a href=\"papers/\">publications</a>\n(most can be downloaded)\nthat have emerged from my research and teaching efforts.\nYou can also visit my\n<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jQNt6RwAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">\nGoogle Scholar page</a> for a view of high-impact papers and collaborators.\n\n\n\n</p><h3><font face=\"Helvetica\" size=\"3\" color=\"#800000\"><strong>\nTeaching Interests:</strong></font></h3>\n<p>\nI teach classes that explore the role of humans in designing and using technology.\nMy classes tend to be highly interactive, with a mix of teaching styles that seeks to\nengage people of varying skills, interests, and abilities.  I greatly enjoy developing\nin-class activities that ask students to apply the skills they are learning to\nproblems that are relevant to the region, state, country, and world.  Most recently I\nhave been developing activities around the theme \"Technology on the Trail\", that looks\nat ways that technology can help inform and engage users on extended journeys without\ninterfering negatively in their experience.  I am happy to share teaching materials\nfor courses listed below.\n</p><p>\nI also seek out interesting and engaging teaching experiences, and I am open to offers\nto teach elsewhere!  I spent a semester in Egypt (Alexandria and Cairo) teaching classes\non human-computer interaction, interface design, and information visualization.  I also\ntaught during two abbreviated summer programs at the University of Colorado, Boulder.\nAnd I led a multi-university undergraduate course partnering\nwith Historically Black Colleges and Universities\nfocused on research methods for undergrads.\n</p><p>\n<b> Fall 2020 Teaching Schedule: </b>\n</p><ul>\n <li>CS 3714 Ethics and Professionalism in Computing, MW 2:30pm-3:45pm</li>\n</ul>\n\n<b> Classes taught: </b>\n<p>\nThese classes are ordered based (roughly) on the frequency with which I teach them.  The lead number\ndescribes the intended course audience; i.e., 1000-level courses tend to have no prerequisites and are for targeted for freshmen, 2000-3000 may have a few prereqs and are targeted for sophomores and juniors, 4000 tend to have multiple prereqs and are targeted for junior and seniors, 5000 are for seniors and first-year grad students, 6000 are for advanced grad students who have had relevant 5000-level classes.\n</p><ul>\n <li><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">CS 3724 Introduction to Human Computer Interaction (Fall 2018, Spring 2018, Spring 2017, Spring 2014, Summer

Interests:</strong></font></h3>\n<p>\nThe focus of my outreach efforts is on <b>inclusion</b> of a diverse set of\nperspectives into the fields of human-computer interaction and computer science.\nMuch of my outreach work has centered on inclusion of women, minorities,\npeople with disabilities, and people in other underrepresented groups.\nMy philosophy is that there are a great many excellent people\nwho do not feel welcome or comfortable in computing and technology-related fields,\nand it is worthwhile and productive for the discipline and the individuals\nthat we together instantiate progress toward inclusion.\nI'm active on several fronts for the <a href=\"http://www.ncwit.org\" <=\"\" a=\"\">\nNCWIT</a> organization, and\nI'm honored to have received the\n<a href=\"http://www.ncwit.org/news/computing-professors-receive-ncwit-research-mentoring-award-work-students&quot;\">NCWIT Research Mentoring Award</a> in 2012\nfor my work with women and minority undergraduate students in research-related activities.\nI was part of our departmental team that received the <a href=\"\">\nNCWIT Extension Services Transformation Award</a> in 2016\nin recognition of our commitment to and proven results in recruiting and retaining women\ninto undergraduate computing programs.\nI was the founding chair of the CS@VT Diversity Committee\nand continue to organize a lot of outreach activities,\nand I am the faculty adviser to our <a href=\"https://www.cs.vt.edu/student_groups\">\nComputer Science Community Service (CS Squared)</a>\norganization that coordinates volunteers in schools and community centers in our region.\n</p><p>\nPrior diversity activities include serving as director\nfor the Center for HCI's summer\nREU Site program, with a number of minority and women's colleges acting as partners.\nI served as co-PI of A4RC,\nan NSF Broadening Participation in Computing (BPC)\nAlliance led by North Carolina A&amp;T State University that helped establish\nan alliance between minority universities and research universities\nfor collaborative education and research.\nI've also worked with the NSF Advance program on\nonline dissemination of materials\nrelated to the participation of women in science and engineering\nin graduate education through VT Advance.\n</p><p>\nI'm also actively working to promote research within the CHI community.\nIn 2014, I was the ACM CSCW Videos co-chair with Katie Derthick.\nIn 2012 I organized an ACM DIS workshop on\n<a href=\"http://people.cs.vt.edu/~mccricks/dis12-cogdisab/\">\nDesigning for Cognitive Limitations</a>\nwith Clayton Lewis.\nIn 2010 I organized an ACM SIGCHI workshop on\n<a href=\"http://people.cs.vt.edu/~swahid/chi2010-artifacts/\">\nArtifacts in Design</a> with Michael Atwood, Gayle Curtis,\nSteve Harrison, Jon Kolko, Erik Stolterman, and Shahtab Wahid.\nI also served on the CHI Program Committee in 2010.\nIn 2007 I was the ACM SIGCHI Work-in-Progress co-chair\nwith Catalina Danis.\nTogether with JJ Cadiz, Mary Czerwinski, and John Stasko\nI organized a workshop at the 2003 ACM SIGCHI Conference on\nProviding Elegant Peripheral Awareness.\nAlso, I was a guest editor with Mary Czerwinski and Lyn Bartram\nfor an IJHCS special issue on the\n<a href=\"http://people.cs.vt.edu/~mccricks/papers/mcb03.pdf\">\nDesign and Evaluation of Notification User
