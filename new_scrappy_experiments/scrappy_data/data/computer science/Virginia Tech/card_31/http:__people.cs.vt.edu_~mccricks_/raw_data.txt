My process side work focuses on ways\nto capture, share, and reuse interface design knowledge.\nMy applications, generally developed for mobile devices\n(tablets, smartwatches, handhelds, and mobile phones),\nfocus on fields in which appropriate notifications\nhave great potential value--health and wellness,\nassistive technologies, hiking and biking,\nwork-order systems, and educational situations.\n", " gathering.\nI'm always interested in working on research projects\nwith motivated students at all levels:\nundergrad, Masters, Ph.D.\nI co-founded and co-direct the \nendergraduate research program\nto encourage undergrads to become involved in research,\nand, for undergraduate students wanting to work with me,\nI sponsor several projects through the program.\nI also teach Senior Capstone classes and grad special topics classes\non a rotating set of themes.\n", "research group page\nfor more details about the research directions of my students and me,\nand view a list of my \n(most can be downloaded)\nthat have emerged from my research and teaching efforts.\nYou can also visit my\n", "\nI teach classes that explore the role of humans in designing and using technology.\nMy classes tend to be highly interactive, with a mix of teaching styles that seeks to\nengage people of varying skills, interests, and abilities.  I greatly enjoy developing\nin-class activities that ask students to apply the skills they are learning to\nproblems that are relevant to the region, state, country, and world.  Most recently I\nhave been developing activities around the theme \"Technology on the Trail\", that looks\nat ways that technology can help inform and engage users on extended journeys without\ninterfering negatively in their experience.  I am happy to share teaching materials\nfor courses listed below.\n", "\nI also seek out interesting and engaging teaching experiences, and I am open to offers\nto teach elsewhere!  I spent a semester in Egypt (Alexandria and Cairo) teaching classes\non human-computer interaction, interface design, and information visualization.  I also\ntaught during two abbreviated summer programs at the University of Colorado, Boulder.\nAnd I led a multi-university undergraduate course partnering\nwith Historically Black Colleges and Universities\nfocused on research methods for undergrads.\n", " in 2012\nfor my work with women and minority undergraduate students in research-related activities.\nI was part of our departmental team that received the ", "\nPrior diversity activities include serving as director\nfor the Center for HCI's summer\nREU Site program, with a number of minority and women's colleges acting as partners.\nI served as co-PI of A4RC,\nan NSF Broadening Participation in Computing (BPC)\nAlliance led by North Carolina A&T State University that helped establish\nan alliance between minority universities and research universities\nfor collaborative education and research.\nI've also worked with the NSF Advance program on\nonline dissemination of materials\nrelated to the participation of women in science and engineering\nin graduate education through VT Advance.\n", "\nI'm also actively working to promote research within the CHI community.\nIn 2014, I was the ACM CSCW Videos co-chair with Katie Derthick.\nIn 2012 I organized an ACM DIS workshop on\n"]}
