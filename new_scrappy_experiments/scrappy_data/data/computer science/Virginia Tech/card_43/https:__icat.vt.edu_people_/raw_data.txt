Benjamin Knapp is the Founding Director of the Institute for Creativity, Arts, and Technology (ICAT) and Professor of Computer Science at Virginia Tech. ICAT seeks to promote research and education at the boundaries between art, design, engineering, and science. Dr. Knapp also leads the Music, Sensors, and Emotion research group, with researchers in the UK and the US.For more than 20 years, Dr. Knapp has been working to create meaningful links between human-computer interaction, universal design, and various forms of creativity. His research on human-computer interaction has focused on the development and design of user-interfaces and software that allow both composers and performers to augment the physical control of a musical instrument with direct sensory interaction. He holds twelve patents and is the co-inventor of the BioMuse system, which enables artists to use gesture, cognition, and emotional state to interact with audio and video media.In previous positions, Dr. Knapp has served as a Fulbright Senior Specialist at University College, Dublin, and chief technology officer of the Technology Research for Independent Living Centre. As the director of technology at MOTO Development Group in San Francisco, Calif., he managed teams of engineers and designers developing human-computer interaction systems for companies such as Sony, Microsoft, and Logitech. He co-founded BioControl Systems, a company that develops mobile bioelectric measurement devices for artistic interaction. Dr. Knapp has also served as professor and chair of the Department of Computer, Information, and Systems Engineering at San Jose State University.", " \n/* - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n            footer + ul/li stuff    \n - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - */\n\n.col-md-4 {padding:0;}\n    \n    footer .footer-content.active {border-bottom: solid 3px #861f41;background-color:#222222;}\n    .vt-rawhtml ol li>ul>li::before, .vt-rawhtml ul>li::before, .vt-text ol li>ul>li::before, .vt-text ul>li::before {display: none;}\n    \n    .vt-rawhtml ul {padding-left:0; margin-left:0; margin-bottom:0;line-height: 1.75em;}\n    \n    .icat-footer-text {display: block;font-family: Acherus,sans-serif;font-size: .8em;\n    font-weight: 300;font-style: normal;line-height: 1.75;-webkit-hyphens: auto;-ms-hyphens: auto;hyphens: auto;vertical-align: text-bottom;color: #fff;width: auto;margin-bottom: 1em;}\n"]}
