We have just moved into our new \n<a href=\"http://www.cs.vt.edu/lasca\">LASCA</a> lab in Torgersen Hall.\nNew parallel computing clusters are being built on campus.\nAnd there is tremendous interest from many application areas,\nparticularly the <a href=\"http://www.bioinformatics.vt.edu/\">Bioinformatics \nInitiative</a> and the \n<a href=\"http://www.vbi.vt.edu/\">Virginia Bioinformatics Institute</a>.\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n", "\n<B>Prospective Students.</B>  If you are interested in doing MS or PhD level\nresearch with me, my recommendation is that you take CS 5485 during Fall 2002,\nand CS 4234 and 6404 during Spring 2003.  You are also welcome to sit in on\nour research group meetings (4:00, Fridays, 2050 Torgersen). \nI will not be taking on any new\nMS students before Spring 2003.  I would consider adding a PhD student this\nsemester.\n"]}
