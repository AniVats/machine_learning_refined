His research has received the best student paper award in CHIIR 2017 (the ACM SIGIR Conference on Human Information Interaction & Retrieval). \n                He holds B.S. and M.S. degrees from Wuhan University, a Ph.D. in Library & Information Science from the University of Pittsburgh, and is finishing up another Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.\n                "]}
