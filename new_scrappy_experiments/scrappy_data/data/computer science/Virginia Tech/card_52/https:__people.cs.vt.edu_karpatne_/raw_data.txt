A primary focus of my research is to advance the growing field of , where machine learning methods are systematically coupled with scientific knowledge (or physics) to accelerate scientific discovery. I am looking forward to work at the boundaries of data science and scientific domains by forging inter-disciplinary collaborations. I am also looking for bright and ambitious students who are motivated to solve real-world problems by pursuing novel research in data science. Before joining Virginia Tech, I received my Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota under the guidance of Prof. Vipin Kumar. I have also had the chance to co-author the textbook,  this Fall semester. This course will provide an overview of  I am serving on the program committee for a cross-disciplinary workshop on \"A new paradigm in lake and reservoir research and management through global monitoring, modeling, and  engaging and empowering people networks,\" which will be held from Sep 5\u20137, 2018 in Washington D.C. This workshop will showcase our efforts in modeling and monitoring water bodies and bring together water scientists and machine learning researchers under the theme of theory-guided data science.Gave an invited talk at Oak Ridge National Laboratory on my research in theory-guided data science and its potential for accelerating knowledge discovery in various scientific disciplines., which was highly relevant for my research on theory-guided data science. It was great interacting with everyone from different disciplines working at the intersections of machine learning and natural sciences.\nStarted my PostDoctoral Associate at the University of Minnesota with Prof. Vipin Kumar. The primary focus of my post-doctoral research is on advancing theory-guided data science.\n\nI served as an instructor for the summer school on \u2018\u2018Intelligent Systems for Geosciences (IS-GEO)\u2019\u2019 at the University of Texas at Austin. It was great interacting with motivated students and researchers from diverse academic and professional backgrounds to get them excited about the growing field of machine learning and its importance in advancing scientific discovery in geosciences.\n  on monitoring surface water dynamics (in collaboration with Dr. Dennis Lettenmaier's research group at UCLA) got accepted for publication at Remote Sensing of Environment (RSE) 2017, a top-tier journal in remote sensing.\n\nPresented our work on modeling the food-energy-water nexus in critical biodiverse landscapes in Cambodia at . My research builds the foundation of this paradigm and I am currently exploring this paradigm for problems in diverse disciplines such as hydrology, climate science, and computational chemistry. Space and time introduce several challenges and opportunities for classical data mining algorithms given the variety of data types, representations, problems, and methods in spatio-temporal settings. My recent survey provides an over-arching structure to the vast and diverse field of spatio-temporal data mining. A recurring theme of my research is to equip data mining methods with a better ability to deal with spatio-temporal data from Earth and environmental sciences. A central challenge in applying standard predictive learning methods for real-world problems is the heterogeneity in data populations, i.e., different groups of instances show different nature of predictive relationships. My dissertation research introduced several novel ways for addressing this challenge, building on ideas from My research has enabled a , V. Mithal, M. Lau, K. Steinhaeuser, S. Boriah, M. Steinbach, V. Kumar, C.S. Potter, S.A. Klooster, T. Abraham, J.D. Stanley, and J.C. Castilla-Rubio, I am looking forward to work with bright and ambitious students who are motivated to pursue research in machine learning and enable solutions to problems of great scientific and societal relevance. I find working on real-world problems to be both intellectually stimulating and socially rewarding, given the variety of challenges faced in analyzing complex physical data that offer fertile grounds for novel research. A major focus of my current work is in the area of theory-guided data science and I have several exciting projects in this space of research. If you are an undergraduate or graduate student who is interested in working with me, please feel free to shoot me an email with your CV/resume, and information about yourself including your major, technical background, specific application areas of interest (if any), and prior research experience (if any).\n          \n \nMoroever, it is the joy of making an impact on some of the most pressing challenges facing our society that fuels my agenda for inter-disciplinary research. \n          \n          Success in this endeavor requires being up-to-speed with the latest technological innovations in the swiftly moving field of data science, while having the ability to effortlessly cross disciplinary boundaries and translate data-enabled results to domain insights. \n "]}
