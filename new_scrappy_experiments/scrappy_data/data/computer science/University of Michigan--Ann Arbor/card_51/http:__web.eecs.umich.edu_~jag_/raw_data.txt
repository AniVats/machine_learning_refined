In this context, I am thinking\nabout topics such as data modeling, schema design, schema summarization, form\ngeneration, natural language querying, and analytics with missing data and imprecise queries.  I gave a keynote speech\nat SIGMOD on \nMy current research is centered around usability of Big Data, particularly when the data involved comes from multiple heterogeneous \nsources, and has undergone many manipulations.  Please see the \nbioinformatics program\nI have benefitted greatly from my collaborations with researchers in other disciplines in understanding real problems users have with managing data.  I have had a number of such collaborations, with researchers in multiple disciplines.  My newest collaborations are with the "]}
