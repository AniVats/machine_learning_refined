In this context, I am thinking\nabout topics such as data modeling, schema design, schema summarization, form\ngeneration, natural language querying, and analytics with missing data and imprecise queries.  I gave a keynote speech\nat SIGMOD on <a href=\"http://www.eecs.umich.edu/db/usable\"> database\nusability </a>. \n</p><p>\nMy current research is centered around usability of Big Data, particularly when the data involved comes from multiple heterogeneous \nsources, and has undergone many manipulations.  Please see the \n<a href=\"http://www.eecs.umich.edu/db/usable\"> web page on database usability\n</a> for more details.  This work has been supported in part by NSF grant\n<a href=\"http://www.eecs.umich.edu/db/usable/presentation.html\">IIS\n0741620, IIS 1017296, and IIS 1250880</a>.  A related concern is how to design effective, usable database systems, funded in part by NSF grant SoD 0438909.  \nThis work also naturally leads into a study of \n<a href=\"http://fodava.gatech.edu/node/72\">visual analytics</a>, where we try\nto help a human find patterns in large complex data sets rather than just\nuse a data mining algorithm, funded in part by NSF grant 0808824.\n</p><p>\nI am part of the \n<a href=\"http://www.eecs.umich.edu/db/\">database group</a> and was Director of the <a href=\"http://www.eecs.umich.edu/ssl/\">software systems laboratory</a> for the past several years.  I am also affiliated with the <a href=\"http://www.bioinformatics.med.umich.edu/\">bioinformatics program</a>\nand serve on the executive committee of the <a href=\"http://ccmb.med.umich.edu/\">Center for Computational Medicine and\nBioinformatics</a>.  \nI also served on the steering committee for the interdisciplinary <a href=\"http://informatics.umich.edu/\">Informatics</a> concentration for\nundergraduates at the University of Michigan.\n</p><p>\nI have benefitted greatly from my collaborations with researchers in other disciplines in understanding real problems users have with managing data.  I have had a number of such collaborations, with researchers in multiple disciplines.  My newest collaborations are with the <a href=\"http://prisms.engin.umich.edu/#/prisms\">PRISMS center</a>, building a \"Materials Commons\" repository, and with the Michigan Center for Research in Critical Care.\n</p></font><p><font face=\"Arial,Helvetica\">\nI am among the fifteen top researchers in the database area, according to Microsoft Academic Search.  I have an h-index of 69, which means I have 69 papers with at least 69 citations each.  Over my lifetime, I have published more papers in VLDB than anyone else.\n</font>\n\n\n</p><h2>\n<font face=\"Arial,Helvetica\">Teaching</font></h2>\n<font face=\"Arial,Helvetica\">Courses related to database management, dat analysis, the web, and data structures and algorithms.  See <a href=\"teaching.html\">details</a>.</font> \n\n<h2>\n<font face=\"Arial,Helvetica\">Bio</font></h2>\n<font face=\"Arial,Helvetica\">I obtained my Ph. D. from Stanford in\n1985, and worked many years for <a href=\"http://www.research.att.com/\">AT&amp;T</a>, where I eventually headed the\ndatabase department.  I arrived here in the fall of\n1999, after a brief detour through the <a href=\"http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/\">University of Illinois</a>.\n</font><p><font face=\"Arial,Helvetica\">\nI have been concerned about how academic scholarship is demonstrated, and\nhave been involved with several efforts in this direction.  I established the\n<a href=\"http://www.eecs.umich.edu/digital-review/\">ACM SIGMOD Digital\nReview</a>, which provides online reviews of published articles, now\nmigrated to <a href=\"http://pubzone.org/\">Pubzone</a>.  As a complementary\neffort, I serve as the editor for the database section of the \n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/corr/\">Computing Research Repository (CoRR)</a>\n, which encourages publication prior to review.\nI am the founder of the <a href=\"http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/\">Proceedings of\nthe Very Large Database Endowment (PVLDB)</a>, which is an effort to bring\njournal-style reviewing to a prestigious conference.  \n</font>\n\n\n\n</p></body></html>"
