My research contributes graph-theoretical ideas and models for exploring a single graph (e.g., graph summarization, inference), as well as multiple graphs simultaneously (e.g., methods for temporal graphs or longitudinal data, similarity and alignment). Real applications of my work include exploration of scientific data, anomaly detection, and re-identification.and understanding one or more massive graphs.\nIn addition to fast algorithmic methodologies, my research also contributes  graph-theoretical ideas and models, and real-world applications in two main areas:\n(i) Single-graph exploration, which includes graph summarization and inference; (ii) Multiple-graph exploration, which includes summarization of time-evolving graphs, graph similarity and network alignment. listed on this page, send an email with your interests and CV to \n<div class=\"Menu\">\n\n\n<div id=\"table-wrapper\">\n  <div id=\"table-scroll\">\n<table class=\"newsTable\">\n<div class=\"header-background\"></div>\n<caption>News</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><div class=\"th-inner\">News</div></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr> <td><b>May 17-22: </b>  Presenting our paper on controversies and information seeking at WWW! </td>  </tr>\n<tr> <td><b>May 13, 2015: </b>  Our paper on temporal graph summarization was accepted at KDD!</td>  </tr>\n<tr> <td><b>Feb - May: </b>  Traveling and traveling and traveling.</td>  </tr>\n<tr> <td><b>Jan 12-13, 2015: </b>  Visiting the Saarland University and giving a talk on understan-ding large graphs.</td>  </tr>\n<tr> <td><b>Dec 21, 2014: </b>  Uploaded the slides for our ICDM tutorial <a href=\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dkoutra/tut/icdm14.html\">here</a>.</td>  </tr>\n<tr> <td><b>Dec 14-17, 2014: </b> Giving a tutorial on node and graph similarity at <a href=\"http://icdm2014.sfu.ca/home.html\">ICDM'14</a> @ Shenzen, China (with <a href=\"http://eliassi.org/\">Tina Eliassi-Rad</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~christos/\">Christos Faloutsos</a>).</td>  </tr>\n<tr> <td><b>Nov 2-4, 2014: </b> Invited to attend the <a href=\"http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/XRG/risingstars/\">Rising Stars in EECS</a> Workshop @ UC Berkeley.</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td><b>Oct 5-8, 2014: </b> In Hawaii, to advertize <a href=\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dkoutra/papers/Glance.pdf\">Glance</a> and explore <a href=http://www.acm.org/uist/uist2014/>UIST'14</a>.</td>  </tr>\n<tr> <td><b>Sept 20-27, 2014: </b> Selected to attend the <a href=\"http://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/\">2nd Heidelberg Laureate Forum</a> in Germany.</td>  </tr>\n<tr> <td><b>Sept 18-19, 2014: </b> Invited talk at <a href=\"http://mlconf.com/\">MLconf</a>, in Atlanta.</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td><b>Aug 23-28, 2014: </b> at <a href=\"http://www.kdd.org/kdd2014/\">KDD</a>, New York.</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td><b>May 14, 2014: </b> <a href=\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dkoutra/papers/controversies_TAIA.pdf\">Events and Controversies</a> in the news (<a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/view/527311/sandy-hook-the-gun-control-debate-and-the-insidious-influence-of-the-filter-bubble/\" target=\"_blank\">MIT Technology Review</a>, <a href=\"http://www.technology.org/2014/05/13/ideological-internet-bubbles-stay-strong-study-shows/#\" target=\"_blank\">Technology.org</a>)! </td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"header-background\"></div> Congratulations to undergraduate researcher  for winning an honorable mention in CRA's outstanding undergraduate research award program!    \n introduces the problem of personalized KG summarization, which is motivated by the disparity between individuals\u2019 limited information needs and the massive scale of KGs;  the inferred summaries can be stored and utilized on-device, allowing individuals private, anytime access to the information that interests them most. \nThe second paper, Amazon research  awardcareer transitions in computing researchNSF graduate research fellowship Our paper \"Biogeography and environmental conditions shape bacteriophage-bacteria networks across the human microbiome\" was accepted in PLOS Computational Biology.Biogeography & environmental conditions shape bacteriophage-bacteria networks across the human microbiome., Philadelphia, PA, April 2014.
