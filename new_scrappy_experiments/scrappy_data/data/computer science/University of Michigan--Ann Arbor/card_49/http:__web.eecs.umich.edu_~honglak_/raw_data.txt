In particular, I focus on deep learning and representation learning, which aims to learn an abstract representation of the data by a hierarchical and compositional structure. My research also spans over related topics, such as graphical models, optimization, and large-scale learning. Specific application areas include computer vision, audio recognition, robotics, text modeling, and healthcare. <br/>\n\n<b>Keywords:</b> Deep Learning, Unsupervised Feature Learning, Semi-supervised Learning, Transfer Learning, Graphical Models, Optimization, Large-scale Learning\n\n\n<a href=\"http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fmSHtE8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Google Scholar Profile</a>"]}
