My work and collaborations aim to discover methods for computational reasoning and perception that will enable robots to effectively assist people in common human environments.  Essentially, we explore how to make the real world programmable through the control of autonomous robots.  Critical challenges towards this goal are enabling robots to perceive our world (i.e., \"robots can't work if they can't see\"), reason under uncertainty, and learn from human users.  This research pertains primarily to interactive robotics with contributions the technology of robot perception and mobile manipulation as well as the usability of this technology by people in real situations.  Because science <b>is exactly</b> independently verifiable knowledge, open-source contributions and reproducibility are critical features of my work.  \n</p>\n\n<p>\nI am currently serving as Editor-in-Chief for the <a href=\"http://thri.acm.org\">ACM Transactions on Human-Robot Interaction</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nProjects over my career are highlighted in this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Dw9tJ_j_k5Vse2bnpDfEZO4XnCVpvcW\">robotics research video playlist</a>. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nMy active projects include <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZJLD_6v88KA\">Semantic Robot Programming</a> for declarative robot programming from demonstration, perceptual reasoning for <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8LFghHtEIAI\">goal-directed robotic manipulation</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.10487.pdf\">fast nonparametric belief propagation</a> for manipulation in clutter, interactive systems for assisted robot teleoperation, and independent living technologies for aging populations.

Robotics and computing technology is having an incredible impact on society.  However, the wisdom needed for this impact to be positive and beneficial requires broader participation across society.  Towards this end, I actively engage in activities to broaden participation in robotics and computing along many dimensions, including improving engagement with students from underrepesented groups.  I have co-authored a high-level primer and opinion article on the role of robotics and automation in society:\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n          <li>O. Jenkins, A.

This talk also includes my perspective on robotics in relation to the future of work and equal opportunity.\nAn overview of my work and thoughts on web robotics (as a convergence of human-robot interaction and cloud robotics) was presented at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iv8aDjs4r1A\"> National Geographic in 2013</a>.  A popular spinout from this talk was my <a href=\"https://embed-ssl.ted.com/talks/henry_evans_and_chad_jenkins_meet_the_robots_for_humanity.html\">TED presentation with Henry Evans</a> that goes into more detail about web robotics and remote presence for people with disabilities (which I guess is everyone). \n</p>\n\n     <h2><a name=\"shortbio\"></a>Short Biography</h2>\n           <p>    \nOdest Chadwicke Jenkins, Ph.D., is an Associate Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan.
