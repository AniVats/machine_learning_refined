On the purely-CS side,\nI am particularly concerned with automatic or minimally-guided techniques\nthat can scale and be applied easily to large, existing programs. I believe\nthat finding bugs is insufficient, and I also work to help programmers\naddress defects, understand programs, and program correctly. \n\n\nCurrent major research interests and areas:\n\n<ul>\n<div class=\"row\">\n\n<div class=\"col-xs-8 col-md-8\">\n<b>Medical Imaging, Consciousness \nand Time</b>. I believe consciousness to be primal,\nrelevant, inadequately explained, and amenable to experimentation: to me, it\nis the most interesting of the big problems. I believe the experience of\nconsciousness over time to be a <i>hard</i> problem (in a sense akin to \n<i>NP-Hard</i>) in that solving it would allow us to solve most other\nproblems. While these are not typically research problems considered\nin computer science, I believe they are becoming approachable through \nmodern medical imaging and \ninterested prospective students are \nencouraged to compare <a href=\"consciousness-time/consciousness-time.pdf\">my thoughts on the\nsubject</a> to their own.\n  <ul>\n Indicative Paper: \n    <a href=\"p/weimer-icse2017-preprint.pdf\">\n    Decoding the representation of code in the brain: An fMRI study of\n    code review and expertise</a> <b>(distinguished paper award, ICSE 2017)</b>\n\n <a href=\"fmri.html\">Project and Dataset Webpage</a> \n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"col-xs-4 col-md-4\">\n<img height=\"140\" src=\"image-medical.png\" width=\"280\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n\n<div class=\"col-xs-8 col-md-8\">\n<b>Automated Program Repair</b>. \nWe have\npioneered algorithms, such as\n<a href=\"https://squareslab.github.io/genprog-code/\">GenProg</a>,\nto synthesize repairs for defects in legacy programs\nusing only standard testcases (no code annotations or formal\nspecifications).
