Examples include search engines that can deliver the right kind of personalized information at the right time, and intelligent tutoring systems that learn when and how to be most helpful in teaching a particular student.  Building effective, reliable systems like these will require new theoretical, algorithmic, and methodological advances in multiple research areas, including machine learning, optimization, information retrieval, and human-computer interaction. My current research is centered on education, but I'm also interested in mobile and health-related applications.Before joining the University of Michigan in Fall 2013, I was a researcher at , France's national research institute for computer science. I am not available at the University of Michigan campus and not accepting new students into my research group. Also, please expect likely delays in email replies.\n        \nJuly-August 2018: Visiting researcher at Microsoft Research AI. \n        \nOct 27 2017: I'll be presenting recent research at Carnegie Mellon's K.
