Prior to that, he was a Postdoctoral Associate at MIT. He earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from UCLA in 2011. His research career has led to many successful open-source projects, including bio \nDatabase research has mostly focused on improving the raw performance of database systems, while neglecting the predictability of their performance.\nNSF has funded us to\nrethink this traditional architecture, and build a new class of databases that guarantee predictability.\n\t\nFunded by National Institutes of Health, we have launched our Big Data Summer Institute, where you can learn about Big Data, statistics and bio-informatics while getting paid!\nAll details and how to apply, can be found researchOur research is made possible through the generosity of the University of Michigan."]}
