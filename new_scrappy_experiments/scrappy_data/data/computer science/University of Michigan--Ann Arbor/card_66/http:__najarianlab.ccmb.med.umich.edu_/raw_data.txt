Using insightful bio-markers and underlying patterns extracted from raw data via signal processing, image processing and machine learning techniques, these systems can provide real-time, on-the-fly treatment recommendations and outcome predictions at every stage of care. By assisting physicians in this manner, patient care can be improved, costs can be reduced and expertise can be provided in cases where medical experts are not immediately available. Example applications of these systems are in cases of traumatic injury and hemorrhagic shock; where all available structured and un-structured health data of the patient is processed as and when it\u2019s made available to produce diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive analysis of the patients conditions in real time. The raw data we analyze includes time-series waveform data such as ECG, ABP etc., medical imaging data such as CT, X-Rray, MRI & fMRI, etc., and all other related patient centric information such demographic information, EHR variables, lab results etc.\nComputational medicine encompasses the techniques that apply mathematical tools to extract important diagnostic information from biomedical and biological data. Data mining techniques can then be applied to train expert systems on existing data and classify new examples. The core research and development of the lab is primarily focused on developing novel mathematical techniques of signal processing, image processing and machine learning towards developing novel solutions for medicine. However, due to the size, complexity and the disparate nature of medical data, we also use and develop variety to techniques for data wrangling, data imputation, data aggregation, alignment, multi-core multi-threaded processing, distributed computing, etc. which help us develop effective, robust and commercial grade medical discussion assist systems.
