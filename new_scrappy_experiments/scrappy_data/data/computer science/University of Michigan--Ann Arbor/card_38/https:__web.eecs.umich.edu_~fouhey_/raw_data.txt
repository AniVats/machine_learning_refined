This has lead to research on\nunderstanding the world in terms of:\n<ul>\n<b>physical properties</b>: How do we recover a rich 3D world from a 2D image? \nI am especially interested in representations -- the answers that are obvious\nare also obviously defective -- as well as how we should reconcile our strong\nprior knowledge about this structure of the problem with data-driven\ntechniques.<br/> Lately, I've become interested in applying this more broadly with the\nhope that we can develop AI systems that can learn how the physical world\nworks from observation, including work on solar physics.\n<b>functional properties</b>: How do we infer and\nunderstand opportunities for\ninteraction? I am interested how an agent (e.g., human or robot) can\ninteract with the world, including in terms of what this implies for 3D understanding.\n</ul>\n\n<a name=\"students\"></a>\n<div class=\"mainbox contentbox\">"]}
