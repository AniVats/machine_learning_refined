This is difficult with very large (500-1000 student) \n\t\tclasses where there is no single reason why students are motivated to take the class and\n\t\tno single reason why students struggle to succeed. Education research is one way to\n\t\tlisten to students' needs.\n\t\t\n\n<b>Autonomous vehicle security:</b>\n\t    Autonomous vehicle software, such as <a href=\"https://http://apollo.auto/\">Apollo</a>,\n\t    is implemented as a distributed system, with multiple modules communicating using\n\t    message passing. I am creating tools that can automatically identify vulnerabilities\n\t    in the ways these modules interact, which developers can use to secure these critical systems.\n\t  \n<b>GPU multi-kernel execution:</b>\n\t    When multiple kernels are run at the same time on the same GPU, they can often acheive\n\t    higher throughput than when they are run consecutively, because there are times they\n\t    have complementary resource requirements. During other times, they can interfere. My\n\t    work finds resource paritions that limit the impact of interference.\n\t  \n<b>GPU register file design:</b>\n\t    GPUs need to have hundreds of kilobytes of register file, because so many threads are executing\n\t    simultaneously. However, not many of these registers are accessed in any given period of time.\n\t    RegLess <a href=\"http://dl.acm.org/authorize?N48355\">(published MICRO 2017)</a> is a\n\t    technique to save energy using a much smaller register structure that\n\t    stores only active registers.\n\t  \n\n<b>GPU memory coalescing:</b>\n\t      Nearby threads on a GPU tend to access nearby locations in memory, allowing\n\t      requests to the same cache lines to be merged to increase memory throughput.\n\t      WarpPool (<a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N31247\">published MICRO 2015</a>)\n\t      used a new type of memory locality between loads made by different thread groups\n\t      to merge more requests."]}
