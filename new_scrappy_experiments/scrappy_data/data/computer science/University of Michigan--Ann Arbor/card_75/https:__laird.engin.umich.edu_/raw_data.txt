My thesis advisor was Allen Newell. I was a member of research staff at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center from 1984 to 1986.\u00a0of the University of Southern California.\u00a0This award recognizes our research on cognitive architectures, especially the\u00a0My major research interest is in creating human-level artificial intelligent entities, with an emphasis on the underlying cognitive architecture. A major challenge is to create systems that can work on a broad range of problems, using a wide variety of methods, knowledge, and learning techniques. As part of my research, I study both artificial and natural intelligence. Since 1981, my work has centered on the development and use of , a general cognitive architecture. Over the years, this has led to research in both . Within AI my work has included research in general problem solving, the genesis of the weak methods, the origins of subgoals, general learning mechanisms, interacting with external environments, learning by experience and by instruction, and integrating reactivity, planning, and learning, all in the service of constructing complete autonomous intelligent agents. In the past, I\u2019ve done some work on developing human-level AI agents for military simulations, , and most recently autonomous robotics. Within cognitive science, my early research has concentrated on detailed modeling of human behavior (reaction times and error rates) in visual attention, concept acquisition, and dual tasks. Currently I\u2019m concentrating on high-level cognition. Most recently, my students and I have extended Soar to include reinforcement learning, episodic memory, semantic memory, mental imagery, and emotion-inspired processing. We are exploring"]}
