The first goal of the research is to create automated classifiers to measure the quality of everyday online political talk. The second goal of the research is to create a Conversation Coach that helps the general public to improve the quality of conversation spaces they participate in, by helping them craft messages that directly contribute to quality and that indirectly inspire others.</p>\n\t<p class=\"readmore\"><a href=\"projects.html#deliberation\">Continue Reading \u00bb</a></p>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <br class=\"clear\">\n  </div>\n  \n  <div id=\"homecontent\">\n  <h3>Prospective Students</h3>\n  <br>\n  <p>Prospective PhD students must first be admitted to UMSI's PhD program before they can work with an individual advisor. \n  If you are interested in working with me, please first <a href=\"https://www.si.umich.edu/academics/admissions/phd-application-requirements\">apply</a> to our program and then drop me an email.\n  Undergraduate and Masters students who have already been admitted to the University of Michigan and are interested \n  in working on computational social science problems are welcome to contact me. \n  Include your interests, degree, major, and resume in your email. </p>\n  </div>\n  <!-- ####################################################################################################### -->\n  <div id=\"copyright\">\n    <p class=\"fl_left\">School of Information, University of Michigan</p>\n    <p class=\"fl_right\"> 4322 North Quad, 105 S.
