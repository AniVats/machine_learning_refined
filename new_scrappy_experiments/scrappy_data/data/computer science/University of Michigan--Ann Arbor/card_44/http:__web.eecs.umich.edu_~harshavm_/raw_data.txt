Most of\nhis work focuses on simplifying the development of and enabling the\ncost-effective deployment of performant, highly available, and\nprivacy-preserving Internet-scale software services.\n\nMany of the systems developed as part of his research have been widely used\nand have had significant impact.  For example, WhyHigh has reduced latencies to\nGoogle by an order of magnitude for millions of users, the MyPageKeeper system\nfor detecting social malware is in use by over 20,000 Facebook users, and\nInternet topology and performance data from the iPlane system has been used in\nresearch projects at over 100 institutions.  His work has also received the\nIRTF's Applied Networking Research Prize and led to\naward papers at the USENIX NSDI, ACM SIGCOMM IMC, and IEEE CNS conferences.\n\nHis research has received support from the Army Research Office (ARO), the\nDefense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), the  Intelligence Advanced Research\nProjects Activity (IARPA) agency, Amazon, VMware, multiple Google Faculty\nResearch awards, a NetApp Faculty Fellowship, a Facebook Faculty Award, and an \nNSF CAREER award.\n"]}
