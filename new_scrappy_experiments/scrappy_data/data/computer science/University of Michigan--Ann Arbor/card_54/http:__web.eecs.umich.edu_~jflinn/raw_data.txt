Some of our ongoing projects are improving application debugging by harnessing the power of cluster-scale computing; leveraging pervasive deterministic record-and-replay to provide information provenance, improve storage systems, and accelerate applications; and using redundancy in network selection and edge computing to improve mobile application response times.\u00a0.\u00a0 If you are an active researcher or practitioner (or just interested) in mobile computing, you should join.\u00a0I wrote a lecture for the Morgan Claypool Synthesis Lectures on Mobile and Pervasive Computing series that surveys and reflects on much of the research that is fueling current interest in edge computing.
