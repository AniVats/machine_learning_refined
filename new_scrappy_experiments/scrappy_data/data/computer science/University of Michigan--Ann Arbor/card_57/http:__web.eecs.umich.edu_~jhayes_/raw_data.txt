There is currently (2018)\nan RA position in the area of stochastic computing and its application to\nneural network design. : This is available in the form of\nfellowships, research assistantships, and teaching assistantships. New students\nare admitted at two levels, MS and PhD, depending on their qualifications.\nStudents entering with a BS degree may be admitted at either level; however, only\nthose with outstanding qualifications are admitted at the PhD level. Such\nstudents will normally obtain an MS from Michigan en route to the PhD degree. Applicants\nwho already have an MS degree in a relevant area can only be admitted at the\nPhD level. An exceptionally attractive\nfeature of our program is that students admitted at the PhD level are\nguaranteed full financial support throughout their MS/PhD studies, as long as\nthey are making satisfactory progress. PhD-bound students are typically\nsupported as fellows, TAs or RAs in their first year, and as RAs or TAs in later\nyears. Admission at the MS level does not normally include financial aid. It\nshould be noted that admission to the PhD level is extremely competitive. Those\nwho are admitted typically have excellent GPA and GRE scores, rank near the top\nof their graduating class at a highly-ranked university, and have strong and\ncredible letters of support that document their specific accomplishments,\nincluding (where applicable) academic achievements, publications, industrial\nexperience, and PhD research potential.For\na flavor of our recent research, see the following papers which you can\ndownload in pdf format.
