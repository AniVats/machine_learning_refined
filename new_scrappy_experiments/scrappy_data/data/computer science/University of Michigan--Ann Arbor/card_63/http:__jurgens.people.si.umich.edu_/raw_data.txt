My research combines linguistic analysis and\n                network science together to understand behavior in its natural\n                social context.  I collaborate with colleagues from areas such\n                as Psychology, Linguistics, Digital Humanities, and Sociology to\n                improve our theories using data-driven insights and\n                methodologies.\n              \n                    at the University of Michigan.  He holds a PhD from the\n                    University of California Los Angeles and was a postdoctoral\n                    scholar in the Department of Computer Science at Stanford\n                    University and prior at McGill University. His research\n                    combines natural language processing, network science and\n                    data science to discover, explain and predict human behavior\n                    in large social systems.  His research has been published in\n                    top computational social science and natural language\n                    processing venues including PNAS, WWW, ACL, ICWSM, EMNLP, and\n                    others.  His work has won the Cozzarelli Prize from the\n                    National Academy of Science, Cialdini Prize from the Society\n                    for Personality and Social Psychology, best paper at ICWSM,\n                    best paper nomination at ACL, and has been featured in news\n                    outlets such as the BBC, Time, MIT Technology Review, and\n                    Forbes.\n\n                    \n\n                  .\n                    Before finishing his PhD, he was a research scientist at\n                    the  at Sapienza University of Rome under Roberto\n                    Navigli.  During his PhD, he was concurrently a visiting\n                    researcher at\n                    the \n                    Broadly, I conduct research in the areas of natural language\n                    processing, computational social science, and data science\n                    to discover, explain and predict human behavior in large\n                    social systems.  My current research focuses on four central\n                    themes spanning these fields:\n                    \n                    \n                      Anyone who has scrolled through a few YouTube comments or\n                      read a newspaper article's comment section knows how\n                      quickly conversation can devolve into incivility.  I\n                      research what effect this has on people and how we can not\n                      only detect such behavior but also mitigate it by\n                      improving empathy.\n                       My long-term research goal combines human and language technologies to create\n                     that reflects both the content\n                    and people involved in communication.  In all my research, I\n                    strive to improve social equality by representing all people\n                    participating in these social systems.\n                  masters students, I typically ask that\n                  you take one of my classes and do well in it before starting\n                  on research.  Often the research you do in one of my graduate\n                  courses can continue on through my lab, if you're interested.\n                  If you've already taken classes before that are similar, send\n                  me an email and we can discuss possibilities.  I will\n                  typically ask new masters students to volunteer in the lab for\n                  a time to show commitment before offering any graduate\n                  assistantship.  This is in part because master's students are\n                  often more caught up in coursework (which is a key part of\n                  graduating), but research requires dedication and continued\n                  effort; demonstrating these early and often generally means\n                  funding sooner.masters students, I do not have any\n                  role in MSI admissions but please feel free to drop me an\n                  email once you've been accepted.  Showing interest in research\n                  prior to starting is usually good sign and gives you more\n                  opportunities during your masters program to see if research\n                  is something you might want to consider.I enjoy working with undergraduates and generally have a\n                  few students working on various projects in my lab.  I do look\n                  for some serious work and effort associated with your research\n                  project , but in turn, if you want a recommendation letter\n                  later, it will reflect that effort.  Typically, the biggest\n                  issue I face is students who over-estimate their time\n                  availability and disappear as coursework starts to pile up.\n                  Good research takes time and consistent effort; bugs will\n                  happen, experiments will fail, and programs will take time to\n                  run, so being able to dedicate a few hours every day () to research is critical.  If you can't see yourself\n                  doing that, it's best to reach out during a semester you think\n                  you will have more time.  I have the easiest time working with technically-oriented\n                    students, who already have good programming skills.  You\n                    will typically be paired with a PhD student who can serve as\n                    an extra mentor and answer your questions.  For some\n                    exceptionally strong students, we can try to get you a\n                    project all to yourself, but this usually requires you\n                    having done research prior.  Occasionally, for bigger\n                    projects, I might pair you with another undergrad so you get\n                    to be your own research team. As a undergrad, you will be expected to join our group's\n                  research meetings.  I typically also try to meet undergrads\n                  twice per week for short meetings so I can provide more rapid\n                  feedback and keep the ball rolling; it's a lot easier to\n                    course correct every few days than once per week.I have yet to hit the upper bound on the number of\n                  undergrads in my lab, so if you're interested, please drop me\n                  a line.  I especially encourage sophomore and junior students\n                  to get involved (earlier is better), so that there's enough\n                  time to do the research and you get the benefit of being in a\n                  lab for longer periods.\n                  visiting students for the summer and (rarely) during the\n                  academic year.  In these cases, usually the student has some\n                  prior research experience, similar research interests, and\n                  (due to luck) there is a current project going on in my lab\n                  where they would be a good fit.  If you are a self-funded\n                  student who wants to come for the summer, you should send an\n                    email in February or March before the summer that\n                     Describes your research experience and state what\n                      parts are relevant to the work going on in my group.\n                       What you want to get out of a summer research\n                        experience and what you want to learn.  This helps me make\n                        sure that the trip is a success for you as well.\n                    Q: Can I research with you or be a member of the Blablablab? "]}
