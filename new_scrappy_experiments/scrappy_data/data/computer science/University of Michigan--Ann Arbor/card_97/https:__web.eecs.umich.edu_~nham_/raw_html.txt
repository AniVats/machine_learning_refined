Before this, I was at the\n\t\t\tUniversity of Washington Bothell for four years in the electrical engineering department.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWinter 2020, I'll be teaching two sections of <a href=\"https://eecs280.org\">EECS 280</a> C++\n\t\t\tand Object-Oriented Programming.  We have over 1200 students enrolled in 5 sections taught by 3\n\t\t\tinstructors and a large and incredibly valuable student staff.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFall 2020, I taught <a href=\"EECS398F19/\">EECS 398</a> System Design of a Search Engine for the\n\t\t\tthird time.  This was an experimental course I created where students worked in teams of six to\n\t\t\tbuild complete internet search engines from scratch in C++.  The top team this time built an index\n\t\t\tof 585M documents.  The plan is for the class to return next year with a permanent number as EECS 440.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>This year, I also serve on our program committee and as our <a href=\"https://www.abet.org/\">\n\t\t\tABET</a> coordinator.  Past years, I've served as an undergraduate advisor.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h4><a name=\"Credentials\"></a>Credentials</h4>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI have a BS and MS EE from Stanford (1973) and an MBA valedictorian from\n\t\t\tBoston University (1987).  I am a life senior member of the IEEE and a registered\n\t\t\tprofessional engineer in Texas and Massachusetts. In 2014, I was\n\t\t\tinducted as an eminent engineer by the Stanford chapter of Tau Beta Pi.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI have 11 issued patents and my publications have received \n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6j7pvpIHC9wC&amp;hl=en\">\n\t\t\tover 2600 citations</a>.  A paper on search engine ranking I co-authored\n\t\t\tat Microsoft won a <a href=\"http://icml.cc/2015/?page_id=51\">\n\t\t\t<i>10-year test-of-time award</i></a> at the 2015 International\n\t\t\tConference on Machine Learning.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h4><a name=\"Career\"></a>Career</h4>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI have spent my career as a designer, most of that as an entrepreneur.  Every\n\t\t\tdesign project I can think of that I have ever worked on has always started\n\t\t\tas a blank sheet of paper.  This is what I think I can teach.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI started my career in gate-level chip design at IBM in the 1970s building\n\t\t\ta reliable serial communications chip, a display processor and various other\n\t\t\thardware devices.  But most of my work has been in software.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI'm the author of <a href=\"https://hamiltonlabs.com/Cshell.htm\">Hamilton C shell</a>,\n\t\t\tnow a little over 250K lines of C.  In December 1988, my C shell became the first\n\t\t\tmultithreaded third-party application to ship on a PC.  It remains the only\n\t\t\tmultithreaded Unix shell in existence on any OS.\n\t\t\t</p>\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI was also the 9th member of the team at Microsoft that created the Bing\n\t\t\tsearch engine.  I personally wrote the query language (the compiler) and ranker\n\t\t\tfor our first release, which went live in January 2005.  My code, roughly 30K\n\t\t\tlines of C++ out of a little over 300K in the backend, decided what our users\n\t\t\twere looking for, searched our index and then ordered the results.  This was\n\t\t\tboth the best and the worst job I have ever had.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h4><a name=\"MyAccidentalPath\"></a>My accidental path to Ann Arbor</h4>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI fell into teaching by accident in 2013.  I thought I was retired and volunteering to act as\n\t\t\ta free advisor to seniors in electrical engineering on their Capstone projects at the University\n\t\t\tof Washington Bothell. I was surprised to find it paid and even more so, that they would pay\n\t\t\tme.  Without a PhD, it was never on my radar that I would someday be teaching at a university.  For\n\t\t\tthe next four years, I taught digital design and Verilog, entrepreneurship, circuits and\n\t\t\ttransistors and advised perhaps a dozen Capstone teams. I love teaching and feel honored and\n\t\t\tdelighted every day that I get to do this.  I love working with my students.  It makes me feel young.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe move to Michigan also began quite by accident when I went offline at Wikipedia to discuss an article on\n\t\t\tflip-flops that another editor and I had been working on.  Most people use pseudonyms on Wikipedia but\n\t\t\twhen we went offline and introduced each other, it was <a href=\"https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~brehob/\">Mark Brehob</a>,\n\t\t\twho insisted I should come to Michigan.  I wasn't looking forward to moving but decided that my advice to\n\t\t\tstudents applied to me:  If you care about your career, you need to go where the opportunity is.  University\n\t\t\tof Michigan has the #7 undergraduate computer engineering program in the country, so after a visit and\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://leccap.engin.umich.edu/leccap/viewer/r/hrssfl\">teaching demo</a> and when it finally\n\t\t\tcame down to an offer, it was clearly an offer I couldn't refuse.  I mothballed my house in Redmond,\n\t\t\trented a townhouse here without ever seeing it, shipped only what I needed and drove here with my\n\t\t\tcat in the back seat of my aging BMW.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tMy impression so far: This is super cool.  My students are smart and interesting, I really like my colleagues,\n\t\t\twho also are very smart and interesting, and I'm really enjoying the way we do things as teams here.  The move\n\t\t\twas definitely worth it.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h4><a name=\"Personal\"></a>Personal</h4>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI'm an Amateur Extra, callsign KD1UJ, though I confess I haven't been\n\t\t\ton the air in years.
