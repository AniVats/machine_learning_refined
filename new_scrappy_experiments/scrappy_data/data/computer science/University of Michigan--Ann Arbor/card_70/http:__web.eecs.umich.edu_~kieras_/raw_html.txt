Kieras </h1> <p>\n\nDavid Kieras is a Professor in the Electrical\nEngineering and Computer Science Department at the University of Michigan. \nHe received a BA in Psychology from Rice University in 1969 and a PhD in\nExperimental Psychology from the University of Michigan in 1974.  After a\ntwo-year R.K. Mellon Post-Doctoral Fellowship at Carnegie-Mellon, he\njoined the Psychology Department as Assistant Professor at the University\nof Arizona.  In 1984, he moved to the University of Michigan where he\n also holds a joint appointment in the Department of Psychology. \n</p><p>His primary general research field is applied and theoretical cognitive\npsychology, with specific interests in human-computer interaction,\ncognitive simulation modeling, human performance, complex human learning,\nand natural language processing.  His research has been supported by ONR,\nARPA, NASA, IBM, and NYNEX Science and Technology.  His research approach\nis to construct computational models for the cognitive processes involved\nin tasks that have practical importance, validate the models against\nempirical data, and prepare them for practical application. \n \n</p><p>  His current research focuses on developing the theory, techniques, \nand tools for analyzing and evaluating usability in HCI, especially with the GLEAN tool for GOMS modeling, \nand on the EPIC advanced cognitive architecture for human performance modeling.\n\n</p><p><a href=\"docs/\"> Click here to view the directory of all downloadable documents</a>\n\n\n</p><h3>Current Projects</h3> <p> \n\n<a href=\"epic.html\">EPIC: A computational cognitive architecture for \nmodeling human performance </a> </p><p>\n\n<a href=\"goms.html\">GOMS Model Work</a> </p><p>\n\n\n</p><h3>Selected Other Publications</h3> <p>\n</p><ul>\n<li><a href=\"HCIref.html\">Human-Computer Interaction</a>  \n</li><li><a href=\"cogref.html\">Cognitive Modeling </a> \n</li><li><a href=\"complexref.html\">Complex Learning </a>\n</li><li><a href=\"nlpref.html\">Natural Language Processing </a>\n</li></ul>\n\n<h3>Course Home Pages</h3> <p>\n</p><ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~eecs381/\">EECS 381 Advanced and Object-Oriented Programming</a>  \n</li></ul>\n</body></html>"
