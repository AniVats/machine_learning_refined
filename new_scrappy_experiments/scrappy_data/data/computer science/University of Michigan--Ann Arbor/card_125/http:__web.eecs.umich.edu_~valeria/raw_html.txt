Specifically, I work on the design of novel, distributed and specialized architectures to boost the execution of big-data applications, I design algorithmic solutions to boost the correctness and reliability of complex silicon architectures at extremely low additional time and cost. Finally, I am working on novel design flows and assembly techniques, including chiplet-based design, to lower the cost of developing novel silicon designs, so that many more engineering teams can dedicate their creativity to the development of new hardware systems.\n</p>\t\n\n\n\n<!--\nThe links below include a recent presentation of the lab, student posters presented during a recent lab visit, and an introduction of the division by our associate chair.

Thurnau Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Associate Dean for Physical Sciences and Engineering in the Rackham Graduate School at the University of Michigan. She is also an Adjunct Professor of Computer Engineering at the Addis Ababa Institute of Technology. Her research interests are in the area of computer design, with emphasis on specialized architecture solutions and design viability, in particular reliability, validation and hardware-security assurance. She joined the University of Michigan in 2003, after working with the Advanced Technology Group of Synopsys, which she joined via the acquisition of Systems Science Inc.<br>\n<p>\n</p><p>\n<!-- Valeria has been a member of  the Executive Committee of the Design Automation Conference since 2013, serving in the role of Technical Program Chair for 2017. The conference is the top forum in hardware and embedded systems design, attracting over 7,000 attendees yearly. She has also served as Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Computer Aided Design. She is the author of three books on correctness in computer design.  -->\n\nValeria is the Director of the ADA (Applications Driving Architectures) Research Center, whose goal is to reignite computing systems design and innovation for the 2030s decade, through specialized heterogeneity, domain-specific language  abstractions and new silicon devices that show benefit to the application. The Center engages 20 faculty members and 95 students from 8 academic institutions in the United States. In her service to the community, she has been a member of the Executive Committee of the Design Automation Conference and served in the role of Technical Program Chair. The conference is the top forum in hardware and embedded systems design, attracting over 7,000 attendees yearly. She has also served as Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Computer Aided Design. \n\n</p><p>\n<!--Valeria has served in several conference program committees, including DATE, DAC and DSN, and has been an Associated Editor for the IEEE Transactions on CAD and the Microelectronics Journal. She is the author of three books on design's functional correctness.-->\nShe received her M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University in 1998 and 2003; and a Computer Engineering degree (\"Dottore in Ingegneria\") summa cum laude from the University of Padova, Italy in 1995. Valeria is the recipient of the IEEE CEDA Early Career Award,  NSF CAREER award, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research's Young Investigator award and the IBM Faculty Award. From the University of Michigan she received the Vulcans Education Excellence Award, the Herbert Kopf Service Excellence Award, the Sarah Goddard Power Award for contribution to the betterment of women and the Rackham Faculty Recognition Award. Valeria is an ACM Distinguished Scientist and an IEEE Fellow.</p><p>\n\n\n\t\t\t</p></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"footer\">\n\t\t\t<div style=\"width: 766px; clear: both; margin-bottom: 1px;\">\n\t\t\t\t<div id=\"lt\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t<div id=\"rt\"></div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div style=\"width: 766px; clear: both\">\n\t\t\t\t<div id=\"lb\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t<div id=\"rb\">\n\t\t\t<br><p align=\"right\"><span class=\"black\">Current time in Michigan: Sunday, 01-Mar-2020 21:03:36 EST</span></p></div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n<p align=\"right\">\n<img src=\"http://counter.www.umich.edu/counter?link=http://www.umich.edu/~valeria/index.html&amp;font=arial&amp;point=10&amp;bgcolor=ffffff&amp;text=999999\"> </p>\n\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n//<![CDATA[\nfront_init();\n//]]>\n</script>\n\n\n\n</body></html>"
