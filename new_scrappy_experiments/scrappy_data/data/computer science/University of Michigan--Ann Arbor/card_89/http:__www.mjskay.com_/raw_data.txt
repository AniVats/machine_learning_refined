I tackle problems using a multi-faceted approach, including qualitative and\nquantitative analysis of behavior, building and evaluating interactive systems, and designing and testing visualization\ntechniques. I co-direct the Midwest Uncertainty Collective (<a href=\"https://mucollective.co/\">MU Collective</a>).\n<strong>Communicating uncertainty:</strong> We are increasingly exposed to sensing and prediction in our daily lives\n(\u201chow many steps did I take today?\u201d, \u201chow long until my bus shows up?\u201d, \u201chow\nmuch do I weigh?\u201d). Uncertainty is both inherent to these systems and usually\npoorly communicated. To build understandable data presentations, we must study\nhow people interpret their data and what goals they have for it. This informs\nthe way that we should communicate results from our models, which in turn\ndetermines what models we must use in the first place. <a href=\"projects.html#uncertainty\">More\u2026</a>\n<strong>Usable statistics:</strong> Science is failing all around us!\nNothing replicates! Things may not be as dire as all that, but in fields like\n<abbr title=\"Human\u2013Computer Interaction\">HCI</abbr> and psychology, the statistical \ntools we use <em>are</em> failing us: these tools let users wander around without guidance\nand produce results without assisting users in interpretation. What would usable \nstatistical tools look like? <a href=\"projects.html#stats\">More\u2026</a>\n<!-- <strong>I\u2019m on the job market!</strong> Check out my <a href=\"research-statement.pdf\">research statement</a>,  -->\n<!-- <a href=\"teaching-statement.pdf\">teaching statement</a>, <a href=\"cv.pdf\"><abbr title=\"Curriculum Vit\u00e6\">C.V.</abbr></a>, -->\n<!-- and <a href=\"references.pdf\">list of references</a>, or download my <a href=\"job-packet.zip\">complete job packet as a zip archive</a>.  -->\n<!-- I am interested in how the communication of uncertainty (or lack of it) affects how people use and trust systems. We are pushing more and more sensing and prediction (\u201chow many steps did I take today?\u201d, \u201chow long until my bus shows up?\u201d) into user-facing applications, and most of these apps simply relay their best estimate to users. Since we will never have perfect predictors or error-free sensors, to effectively build trust we must present the uncertainty in these systems in ways users can understand.

That work has included technology to help people understand and improve their sleep habits&mdash;for example, <a href=\"http://dub.washington.edu/projects/lullaby\">Lullaby,</a> which helps people track environmental factors that disturb sleep&mdash;and technology to improve the communication of software license agreements&mdash;for example, <a href=\"http://hci.uwaterloo.ca/research/textured\">textured agreements</a>, which present relevant information to people in a compelling way, and <a href=\"http://hci.uwaterloo.ca/research/narrative\">narrative pictograms</a>, which employ wordless diagrams to communicate agreement concepts across language barriers. The work on redesigning software agreements was conducted during my Master&#8217;s at the <a href=\"http://www.uwaterloo.ca/\">University of Waterloo</a>, where I was advised by <a href=\"http://hci.uwaterloo.ca/faculty/mterry/\">Michael&nbsp;Terry.</a> -->\n<!-- I am building a better understanding of how people deal with user-facing uncertainty in everyday applications. We are pushing more and more sensing and prediction into people's hands (\"how many steps did I take today?\", \"how long until my next bus?\", etc), but most of these applications just give their best estimate (<em>4672 steps</em> or <em>8 minutes from now</em>) without communicating uncertainty or relating that information to users' goals. Maybe the user wants to know if they met their step goal (\"you passed 10,000 steps with 99% confidence\") or if they will make it to their bus (\"leave in the next 2 minutes to make your bus with 99% confidence\").\n    While these probabilistic formulations may not be in the form end-users would understand, they represent an example way to communicate uncertainty in sensing and predictive data that is aligned with users' goals. Notably, they don't require better prediction. Since we will never live in a world of error-free prediction or sensing, aligning the reflection of error in such systems with users' goals and expectations is necessary to build trust in these systems. I am working on projects both in understanding these goals and representations (of weight data and realtime bus prediction), as well as projects aimed at tuning the underlying models to be sensitive to errors that people actually care about.
