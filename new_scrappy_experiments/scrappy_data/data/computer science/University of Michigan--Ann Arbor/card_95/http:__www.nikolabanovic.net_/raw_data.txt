I envision modeling the human accurately across domains as a theoretical foundation for work in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in which computational models provide a foundation to study, describe, and understand complex human behaviors and support optimization and evaluation of user interfaces.This course will teach students principles and methods of technical Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research. It will also include a survey of important research threads. Short individual assignments will give students exposure to existing research methods in HCI. Midterm and final exams will test the student knowledge of the topic. HCI has become particularly interested in using machine learning (ML) to improve user experience (UX). However, some design researchers claim that there is a lack of design innovation in envisioning how ML might improve UX. We investigate this claim by analyzing 2,494 related HCI research publications. Our review confirmed a lack of research integrating UX and ML. To help span this gap, we mined our corpus to generate a topic landscape, mapping out 7 clusters of ML technical capabilities within HCI. Among them, we identified 3 under-explored clusters that design researchers can dig in and create sensitizing concepts for. To help operationalize these technical design materials, our analysis then identified value channels through which the technical capabilities can provide value for users: self, context, optimal, and utility-capability. The clusters and the value channels collectively mark starting places for envisioning new ways for ML technology to improve people\u2019s lives.The increasing ability to collect large amounts of human behavior data can inform technology that has the potential to help people improve their behaviors and thus improve the quality of their lives. To design and implement such technology requires understanding of those very behaviors that the technology is trying to diagnose and improve. However, existing methods to explore and make sense of human behaviors are not well suited to address the increasingly large amount of data collected in behavior logs. My research focuses on the domain of human routines where I model behaviors as sequences of actions people perform in specific situations. I leverage those computational models of routines together with different visualization tools to aid researchers and domain experts in exploring, making sense of, and generating new insights about human behavior in a principled way. My research informs the design of technology that helps people be productive, healthy, and safe.Human routines are blueprints of behavior, which allow people to accomplish purposeful repetitive tasks at many levels, ranging from the structure of their day to how they drive through an intersection. People express their routines through actions that they perform in the particular situations that triggered those actions. An ability to model routines and understand the situations in which they are likely to occur could allow technology to help people improve their bad habits, inexpert behavior, and other suboptimal routines. However, existing routine models do not capture the causal relationships between situations and actions that describe routines. Our main contribution is the insight that byproducts of an existing activity prediction algorithm can be used to model those causal relationships in routines. We apply this algorithm on two example datasets, and show that the modeled routines are meaningful\u2014that they are predictive of people\u2019s actions and that the modeled causal relationships provide insights about the routines that match findings from previous research. Our approach offers a generalizable solution to model and reason about routines.To replicate or not to replicate experiments and studies seems to be a burning question in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community. This question is equally relevant to the field of mobile computing, where researchers face unique challenges when attempting to replicate studies of mobile device usage in the field. Some of those challenges are inherent in conducting such studies to understand complex socio-technical systems, which involve different technologies and diverse populations of users from different social, economic, and cultural backgrounds. However, those same challenges point to a great opportunity to expand our knowledge of how people use and interact with their mobile devices and understand how those interactions evolve over time.Driven by curiosity and our own three diverse smartphone application usage datasets, we sought to unpack the nuances of mobile device use by revisiting two recent Mobile HCI studies. Our goal was to add to our broader understanding of smartphone usage by investigating if differences in mobile device usage occurred not only across our three datasets, but also in relation to prior work. We found differences in the top-10 apps in each dataset, in the durations and types of interactions as well as in micro-usage patterns. However, it proved very challenging to attribute such differences to a specific factor or set of factors: was it the time frame in which the studies were executed? The recruitment procedure? The experimental method? Using our somewhat troubled analysis, we discuss the challenges and issues of conducting mobile research of this nature and reflect on caveats related to the replicability and generalizability of such work.Sighted individuals often develop significant knowledge about their environment through what they can visually observe. In contrast, individuals who are visually impaired mostly acquire such knowledge about their environment through information that is explicitly related to them. This paper examines the practices that visually impaired individuals use to learn about their environments and the associated challenges. In the first of our two studies, we uncover four types of information needed to master and navigate the environment. We detail how individuals\u2019 context impacts their ability to learn this information, and outline requirements for independent spatial learning. In a second study, we explore how individuals learn about places and activities in their environment. Our findings show that users not only learn information to satisfy their immediate needs, but also to enable future opportunities \u2013 something existing technologies do not fully support. From these findings, we discuss future research and design opportunities to assist the visually impaired in independent spatial learning.General-purpose software applications are usually not tailored for a specific user with specific tasks, strategies or preferences. In order to achieve optimal performance with such applications, users typically need to transition to an alternative efficient behavior. Often, features of such alternative behaviors are not initially accessible and first need to be customized. However, few research works formally study and empirically measure what drives a user to customize. In this paper, we describe the challenges involved in empirically studying customization behaviors, and propose a methodology for formally measuring the impact of potential customization factors. We then demonstrate this methodology by studying the impact of different customization factors on customization behaviors. Our results show that increasing exposure and awareness of customization features, and adding social influence can significantly affect the user's customization behavior."]}
