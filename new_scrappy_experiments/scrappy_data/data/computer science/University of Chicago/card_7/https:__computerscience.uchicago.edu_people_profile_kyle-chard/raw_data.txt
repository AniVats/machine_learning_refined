He also holds a joint appointment at Argonne National Laboratory. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand in 2011.\u00a0 He is a member of the ACM and IEEE,\u00a0 received\u00a0the IEEE TCHPC Award for Excellence for Early Career Researchers\u00a0in HPC, was part of the Globus team that won an R&amp;D100 award, and received\u00a0the New Zealand Top Achiever Doctoral Scholarship.\u00a0\u00a0He co-leads the <a href=\"http://labs.globus.org\">Globus Labs research group,</a>\u00a0which focuses on a broad range of research problems in data-intensive computing and research data management.\u00a0 He leads NSF-funded projects related to distributed and parallel computing, scientific reproducibility, research automation, and cost-aware use of cloud infrastructure.\u00a0\n\nMy research is motivated by exploring a range of challenging scientific problems and developing and applying new computational and data-intensive approaches. I focus on a range of systems problems, often in high performance parallel and distributed computing, with the aim to develop new techniques for scalable and efficient management and analysis of large data. My interdisciplinary research\u00a0has been applied in several scientific domains, including in biology, earth science, materials science, astrophysics, and archaeology.\u00a0\nFind out more about my active research projects on the <a href=\"http://labs.globus.org\">Globus Labs website</a>", "Department of Computer Science\n5730 S.
