The Digital Biology Project seeks to understand how protein systems function in a discrete fashion, especially in the presence of hydrophobic effects (which are very non-specific). FEniCS is a polymorhpic acronym for an international effort (www.fenics.org) that attempts to utilize mathematical structure inherent in scientific models to automate the generation of simulation software.", "Department of Computer Science\n5730 S.
