I am studying the properties of recursively enumerable (r.e.) sets (those which can be generated by a computable procedure), particularly their algebraic structure, the degree of information they encode (Turing degree), their automorphisms, and their computational complexity properties. I am also working on the computable content of certain algebraic structures such as Boolean algebras and models of certain formal systems. Finally I am studying decision procedures for certain subclasses of the r.e. Turing degrees.", "Department of Computer Science\n5730 S.
