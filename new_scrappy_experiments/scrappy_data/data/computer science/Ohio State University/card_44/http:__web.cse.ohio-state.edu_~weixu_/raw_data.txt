I focus on designing algorithms for learning semantics from large data for natural language understanding, and generation in particular with stylistic variations. I recently received the NSF CRII Award, Criteo Faculty Research Award, CrowdFlower AI for Everyone Award, Best Paper Award at COLING'18, as well as research funds from DARPA. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania. I received my PhD in Computer Science from New York University where I was a MacCracken Fellow, MS and BS from Tsinghua University. \n\t\t    \n\t\t     My research group is currently funded by DARPA, NSF and CrowdFlower. \t\n\t        Learn more about <a href=\"#advise\">my group</a> and life in Columbus Ohio.\n\t\n\t        Check out the <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/osunlpcl/\">NLP speaker series</a> at OSU. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tParticularly, I am interested in paraphrase research which concerns phrases or\n\t\t\tsentences that convey the same meaning with different wordings (i.e. synonyms)\n\t\t\t, and which is fundamental for a wide range of natural language\n\t\t\tapplications, including generation, information extraction, machine \n\t\t\ttranslation, summarization, question answering, etc. \n\t \n\t\t<div class=\"content\">\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><a href=\"files/wordcloud_paraphrase_research.png\"><img \n\t\t\t\t\tborder=\"1px\" hspace=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t\tsrc=\"files/wordcloud_paraphrase_research.png\" style=\n\t\t\t\t\t\"float: right;\" width=\"400px\"></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n <li>Dec 2017, congratulations to my phd advisor <a href=\"files/bio_Grishman.pdf\">Ralph Grishman</a> for becoming an ACL Fellow! </li> \n\t\t\t    <li>Nov 2017, talk at IBM Thomas J.

It faces an exponential search space larger than bilingual translation, but a much smaller optimal solution space due to specific task requirements. I advocate for a text-to-text generation framework, building on top of machine translation technologies.
