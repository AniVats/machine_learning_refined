Particularly, my research projects focus on: (1) Machine intelligent question answering (QA) based on various sources, such as knowledge bases, texts, and tables; (2) Human collaborative QA: expert behavior understanding and expertise mining; (3) Knowledge discovery from texts and networks. 10/2019: Our funded research project is selected to highlight by biomedical network embedding (a systematic comparison of 11 advanced graph embedding methods for 4 biomedical prediction tasks) was accepted to  (research track, acceptance rate: ~14.2%, oral presentation). (research track, acceptance rate: ~14.2%, poster presentation). got accepted in WWW 2018. This is our very first work along the research line to facilitate Computer Science for All. 11/2019: Undergraduate research assistant 08/2018: We are very thankful and excited for being funded by the NSF core small program for our research.09/2017: We are very excited and grateful for receiving an ARO grant for our research.Many thanks to NSF, PCORI, ARO, Fujitsu Laboratories of America, and Ohio Supercomputer Center for their generous support of our research. <h2 property=\"dc:title\" datatype=\"\" style=\"color: #990000\"><strong>Awards & Honors</strong></h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"content clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  <div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\">\n<ul><p></p><h3>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                            <li><strong>Regents\u2019 Special Fellowship, UCSB, 2010-2011, 2014-2015.</strong></li>\n                            <li><strong>Ph.D. Progress Award in CS Dept, UCSB 2014</strong></li>\n                            <li><strong>09~12/2015: Visit Baidu Research, Sunnyvale</strong></li>\n                            <li><strong>09/2015: Ph.D. Defense Completion</strong></li>\n<li><strong>06~09/2015: Summer internship in Microsoft Research, Redmond</strong></li>\n<li><strong>05/2015: Our paper &quot;Exploiting Relevance Feedback in Knowledge Graph Search&quot; was accepted in KDD 2015!</strong></li>\n<li><strong>05~06/2015: Visit Army Research Laboratory, Silver Spring, MD</strong></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--<li><strong>03/2015: Talk at the Ohio State University</strong></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>03/2015: Talk at Simon Fraser University</strong></li>"]}
