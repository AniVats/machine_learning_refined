I am particularly \ninterested in the challenges posed by loosely-coupled distributed systems.\nImportant design goals for such systems include security, robustness, reliability,\nand (re)configurability.\nAchieving these goals, however,\nis often frustrated by properties that are inherent in loosely-coupled systems:\npartial synchrony, partial failure, and dynamic assembly.\nMy research addresses these challenges by investigating\ntools, algorithms, and formal methods necessary for supporting\nthe component-based development of such systems.\n\n       (papers, talks, posters, interests) ", "\n                This page is maintained by:\n                 Department of Computer Science and Engineering \n                395 Dreese Lab, 2015 Neil Avenue, Columbus, OH 43210,\n                    Phone: (614) 292-5813 / Fax: (614) 292-2911 \n                If you have trouble accessing this page and need to request an alternate format,\n                    contact webmaster@cse.ohio-state.edu.\n    "]}
