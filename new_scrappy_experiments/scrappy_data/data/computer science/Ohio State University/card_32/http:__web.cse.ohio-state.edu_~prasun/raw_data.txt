I was at Bell Labs from 2001 to 2003, \nafter which I have  been at OSU.\nMy research has been primarily funded through National Science Foundation (NSF), DARPA,\nToyota and Honda. I have led multiple $1M+ cross-university, cross-disciplinary projects. I have advised 1 BS,\n10 MS, 15 PhD students (including current 5 PhD students) and 1 postdoc during my career. The students\nare placed in various positions in industry, industrial research labs as well as academia. I won the prestigious\nNSF CAREER award in 2006. I am an IEEE fellow. I have served in the editorial board for 2 top\njournals (TMC, TWC). I have chaired/co-chaired seven conferences, including MobiCom 2014, which is the topmost conference in\nwireless networking and mobile computing and I have been on the steering committee of IWQoS. I have authored 100+ publications and 4 patents. My best papers include BuildSys 2017, WiOpt 2013 (Best Student Paper Award) and two were selected as best paper finalists (ACM Mobicom 2014, IEEE SECON 2007). \n\n\n\nThe focus of my research group is to make long-term impact in the area of wireless networking, sensing\nand communication. My research group is actively engaged in finding answers \nto fundamental questions in the broad areas listed below:\n\nMy research focuses on the design of wireless network architectures and protocols, \nwith current emphasis on sensor networks and cellular networks. \nMy research focuses on developing algorithmic solutions to foundational problems in wireless networking. \nMy recent contributions have been focused along the following avenues \n(click  for a detailed research statement):\n\nI lead the <a href=\"http://owin.cse.ohio-state.edu/\">\nOhio Wireless Infrastructure and Networking (OWIN) research lab </a>.
