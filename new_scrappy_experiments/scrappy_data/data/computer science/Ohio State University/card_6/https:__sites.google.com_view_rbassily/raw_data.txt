Much of my recent research effort has been devoted to developing practical algorithms with rigorous guarantees for privacy-preserving data analysis and machine learning. The goal of this area of research is to design highly accurate machine learning and data analysis algorithms that use private, personal data while providing rigorous guarantees of privacy for individuals whose data are collected; that is, to achieve the seemingly paradoxical goal of ! Part of my research also addresses fundamental questions in machine learning and privacy. I am looking for bright, self-motivated PhD students to recruit. If you are interested in working with me on one or more of the topics in the link below, feel free to send me a brief email with your background and your resume (including any relevant coursework you have done). Also, taking one of my classes (e.g., CSE 5223: Machine learning theory this Fall) and doing very well is a plus. If you are not currently admitted to OSU, you are encouraged to apply. If that is the case, you are still welcome to send me an email, but, please keep in mind that admissions are decided by the department/university committees."]}
