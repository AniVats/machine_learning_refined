The National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy and the\nNational Institutes of Health have been the primary supporters of my group's\nresearch together with grants and gifts from several industrial sponsors. For a\nrecent example, read more I currently advise the following PhD students (research foci noted):My work in this\nspace was initiated roughly a decade ago. Our initial efforts in this space\nfocused on event-based algorithms for dynamic network analysis, Markov\nclustering and ensemble clustering of networks with applications in\nbioinformatics and clinical informatics. Current foci are in My past work in\nthis space focused on scalable anomaly detection, similarity search (for\nnon-metrics) and the application of machine learning algorithms arising in a\nclinical context. My current interests include usable database systems (e.g.\nquery by output, visual query interfaces), algorithms for similarity search\n(with an emphasis on locality sensitive hashing), contextual anomaly detection,\nand optimization algorithms that arise in machine learning. Selected recent\npapers in this vein include:"]}
