In the 1980s and 1990s, Kaiser investigated  language-based editors and team software development environments, leading to today's IDEs and CI, then in the late 1990s and early 2000s she studied collaborative work via nascent Web technologies and \"autonomic computing\" for emerging cloud computing. Starting with her sabbatical at Columbia's Center for Computational Learning Systems in 2005-2006, Kaiser and her former PhD student  were among the first to apply  software engineering testing techniques to  machine learning software. Her recent work also  applies machine learning techniques to software  engineering problems. Kaiser has advised or  co-advised twenty PhD dissertations and sponsored over two hundred  undergraduate and MS research students. Her lab has been funded by NSF, NIH, DARPA, ONR, NYS Office of Science, Technology and Academic Research, and numerous companies. Prof. Kaiser chaired the program committee for the third ACM SIGSOFT Symposium on Foundations of Software Engineering and was a founding associate editor of ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology. She has served her department as PhD Program Chair since 1997. Prof. Kaiser received her PhD from CMU and her ScB from MIT.  ", "Prof. Kaiser expects to teach COMS E6156 Topics in Software Engineering in Spring 2021. 6156 is not \"more\" 4156, and not \"more advanced\" 4156.  4156 is about doing software engineering, and 6156 is about studying and improving software engineering.  6156 is  a graduate seminar (qualified undergraduates are welcome) oriented towards students who aspire to be researchers or technology leaders.   Students choose their own forward-looking topics within  software engineering, broadly construed, for their presentations throughout the semester, midterm papers and final projects.
