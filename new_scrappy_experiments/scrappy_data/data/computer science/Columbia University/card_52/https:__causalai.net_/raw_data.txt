Specifically, my research work develops formal methods for solving the problem of generalizing causal and statistical knowledge from heterogeneous datasets. Many applications of this problem appear in the empirical sciences  under the rubrics of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_validity\" target=\"_\">external validity</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis\" target=\"_\">meta-analysis</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias\" target=\"_\">selection bias</a>.\n                <li> <img src=\"new.gif\"> I\n                ), \n                short bio (\n                <br>\n                <br>\n                <b>Videos:</b> NeurIPS-13 tutorial, \"Causes and Counterfactuals: Concepts, Principles and Tools,\" link [<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yksduYxEusQ\" , onclick=\"ga('send', 'pageview', { 'page': 'NeurIPS-YT'});\">YT</a>, <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/apps/video/default.aspx?id=206977\" onclick=\"ga('send', 'pageview', { 'page': 'NeurIPS'});\">MSR</a>  (w/ slides)]. <br>\n                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AISTATS-13 talk, \"Meta-Transportability of Causal Effects: A Formal Approach,\" link [<a href=\"http://techtalks.tv/talks/meta-transportability-of-causal-effects-a-formal-approach/58079/\" onclick=\"ga('send', 'pageview', { 'page': 'NeurIPS'});\">TechTalks.TV</a>].\n                 I am thankful for Adobe's generous gift ($50k) and support to our research. \n                 I am thankful for IBM's generous gift ($50k) and support to our research and collaboration. \n                 Our work on solving big data's fusion problem and combining massive sets of research data just appeared at the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), see \n                <p class=\"paper\">\n                <b>Grammatical inference applied to linguistic modeling of biological regulation networks</b><br>\n                 E.
