My work touches on syntactic and semantic parsing, grammar formalisms, lexical and computational semantics, knowledge representation, machine learning.\n<br/>\n In my dissertation, I used synchronous graph grammars to translate sentences into graph-based representations of their meaning and developed efficient algorithms for grammar induction and parsing.  \n\nMy current research interests in computer science education include integrating functional programming into the CS curriculum, understanding how pre-college computing experience shapes performance and attitudes in introductory CS courses, and techniques for improving student engagement."]}
