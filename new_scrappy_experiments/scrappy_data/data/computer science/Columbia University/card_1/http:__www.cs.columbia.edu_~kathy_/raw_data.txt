The first involves text summarization. We are working on\n\t\t\t\t        neural methods for extractive and abstractive summarization over a variety of genres, including informal narratives of personal experience. We have worked on generating updates on disasters over live, streaming information. Our goal\n\t\t\t\t\tis to generate an update of what has happened each hour in the course of\n\t\t\t\t\ta disaster.   In the second area, we are working on generating messages about electricity usage and using reinforcement learning over usage logs to determine what kinds of messages can change behavior. \n\t\t\t\t  Finally, we are also working on the analysis of social media.  We are\n\t\t\t\t\tworking on analysis of the social media posts of gang-involved youth to detect messages about aggression and loss.\n                                  We have also developed\n\t\t\t\t systems to identify influence in social media and to identify an author's personal traits.\n\t\t\t We are now working on identifying sentiment in social media posts made in low resource\n\t\t languages (e.g., Uyghur)..\n\t\t\t\t\tKathleen R.
