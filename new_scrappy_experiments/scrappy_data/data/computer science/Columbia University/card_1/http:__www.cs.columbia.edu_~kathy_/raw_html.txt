The first involves text summarization. We are working on\n\t\t\t\t        neural methods for extractive and abstractive summarization over a variety of genres, including informal narratives of personal experience. We have worked on generating updates on disasters over live, streaming information. Our goal\n\t\t\t\t\tis to generate an update of what has happened each hour in the course of\n\t\t\t\t\ta disaster.   In the second area, we are working on generating messages about electricity usage and using reinforcement learning over usage logs to determine what kinds of messages can change behavior. \n\t\t\t\t  Finally, we are also working on the analysis of social media.  We are\n\t\t\t\t\tworking on analysis of the social media posts of gang-involved youth to detect messages about aggression and loss.\n                                  We have also developed\n\t\t\t\t systems to identify influence in social media and to identify an author's personal traits.\n\t\t\t We are now working on identifying sentiment in social media posts made in low resource\n\t\t languages (e.g., Uyghur)..</p>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"col-md-12 text\">\n\t\t\t\t<b>Biographical Information</b>\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"indent\">\n\t\t\t\t\tKathleen R. McKeown is the Henry and Gertrude Rothschild Professor of\n\t\t\t\t\tComputer Science at Columbia University and is also the Founding Director\n\t\t\t\t\tof the Data Science Institute at Columbia. She served as the Director\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom July 2012 - June 2017. She served as Department\n\t\t\t\t\tChair from 1998-2003 and as Vice Dean for Research for the School of\n\t\t\t\t\tEngineering and Applied Science for two years. McKeown received a Ph.D.\n\t\t\t\t\tin Computer Science from the University of Pennsylvania in 1982 and has been\n\t\t\t\t\tat Columbia since then. Her research interests include text summarization,\n\t\t\t\t\tnatural language generation, multi-media explanation, question-answering and\n\t\t\t\t\tmulti-lingual applications.\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"indent\">\n\t\t\t\t\tIn 1985 she received a National Science Foundation\n\t\t\t\t\tPresidential Young Investigator Award, in 1991 she received a National Science\n\t\t\t\t\tFoundation Faculty Award for Women, in 1994 she was selected as a AAAI Fellow,\n\t\t\t\t\tin 2003 she was elected as an ACM Fellow, and in 2012 she was selected as one\n\t\t\t\t\tof the Founding Fellows of the Association for Computational Linguistics. In\n\t\t\t\t\t2010, she received the Anita Borg Women of Vision Award in Innovation\n\t\t\t\t\tfor her work on text summarization. McKeown is also quite active nationally.
