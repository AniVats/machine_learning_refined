Depending on how you count, I am a first- or second-generation immigrant; my parents both immigrated from Guangdong, China. I lived in the Bay Area until I received my B.S. from <a href=\"https://www.berkeley.edu/\">UC Berkeley</a> in <a href=\"https://eecs.berkeley.edu/\">EECS</a> in 2012. I subsequently moved to Pittsburgh, PA, to study in <a href=\"https://www.ri.cmu.edu\">The Robotics Institute</a> at <a href=\"https://www.cmu.edu/\">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, from which I received my M.S. in 2015 and Ph.D. in 2018 under the advisement of <a href=\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~choset/\">Dr. Howie Choset</a>.</section><footer class=\"page__meta\"></footer></article>"]}
