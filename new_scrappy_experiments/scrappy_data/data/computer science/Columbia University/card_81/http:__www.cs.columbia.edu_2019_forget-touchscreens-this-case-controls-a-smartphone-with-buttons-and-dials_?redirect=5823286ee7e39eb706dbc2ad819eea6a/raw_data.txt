Instead, they take advantage of what happens when you push a button or wind a rotary dial: your finger's force causes the smartphone to move slightly, and this motion can be picked up by the handset's built-in accelerometer and interpreted as an action by software on the phone.Since this movement varies slightly depending on the widget you're touching and where it is on the back of the phone, the researchers wrote an algorithm that can determine which widget is doing what. One demo app they built, for instance, shows a user The researchers aren't the only ones interested in more old-fashioned ways to interact with electronics. Early next year, Portland software company Panic is planning to release a handheld gaming device, The researchers designed and 3-D printed a prototype of the case with eight slots for the rectangular widgets, and 3-D printed parts for a number of widgets to fit into them that look like buttons and rotary dials. Then they put it on an Android smartphone, along with their demo software that lets the widgets control a camera, game, and virtual saxophone.That said, the researchers are giving anyone who's interested in making this reality (and", "\n\nThe WarnerMedia family of brands uses data collected from this site to improve and analyze its functionality and to tailor products, services, ads, and offers to your interests.
