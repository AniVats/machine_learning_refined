From 1961 to 1990 he worked \n   at the Institute of Control Sciences, Moscow, where he became Head \n   of the Computer Science Research Department. He then joined AT&amp;T \n   Bell Laboratories, Holmdel, NJ,\n   having been appointed Professor of Computer Science and Statistics \n   at Royal Holloway in 1995.\nProfessor Vapnik has taught and researched in computer science, theoretical \n   and applied statistics for over 30 years. He has published 6 monographs \n   and over a hundred research papers. His major achievements have been \n   the development of a general theory of minimizing the expected risk \n   using empirical data and a new type of learning machine \n   called Support Vector machine that possesses a high level of generalization \n   ability. These techniques have been used to solve many pattern recognition \n   and regression estimation problems and have been applied to the problems \n   of dependency estimation, forecasting, and constructing intelligent \n   machines.  His current research \n   is presented in his latest books \"Statistical Learning Theory\", \n   Wiley, 1998, and \"The Nature of Statistical Learning Theory\",\n   second edition, Springer, 2000.\n\nHe was one of the invited speakers at the Colloquium\n   <a href=\"/events/compintell1998.htm\">\"The \n   Importance of being Learnable\"</a> hosted by the Computer Learning \n   Research Centre at Royal Holloway in September 1998.\nOn the 10th of February 2006 the National Academy of Engineering \n   (NAE) of USA elected Professor Vapnik as a new member for \"insights \n   into the fundamental complexities of learning and for inventing practical \n   and widely applied machine-learning algorithms\". \nThe citation states that:\n\"Election to the \n   National Academy of Engineering is among the highest professional \n   distinctions. Academy membership honors those who have made outstanding \n   contributions to \"engineering research, practice, or education, \n   including, where appropriate, significant contributions to the engineering \n   literature,\" and to the \"pioneering of new and developing \n   fields of technology, making major advancements in traditional fields \n   of engineering, or developing/implementing innovative approaches to \n   engineering education\".\nIn December 2011 Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems\n  (Tuebingen, Germany) organized\n   <a href=\"http://webdav.tuebingen.mpg.de/empirical-inference/\">\"Empirical\n  Inference Symposium\"</a>\n  in honour of the 75th birthday anniversary of Professor Vapnik.\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><a href=\"/publications/vapnik/index.shtml\">Selected List of Publications</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->\n\n\n<br class=\"TP_clear_both\"/>\n\n\n<div class=\"Bottom-matter\">\n<div id=\"Bottom-matter\">\n<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name=\"Bottom matter\" --><!-- InstanceEndEditable -->\n\n\n\n\n<!-- START BOTTOM SECTION -->\n<div class=\"TP_Last_updated\">\n<div id=\"TP_Last_updated\">\nLast updated\n<!-- #BeginDate format:acEn2m -->Mon, 01-Jan-2012  12:15<!-- #EndDate -->\n<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name=\"Time-zone\" -->GMT<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->\n\n\n<!-- Clearing div -->\n<div class=\"TP_Clear_0_5ex\"><!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- End Main Info Section -->\n\n\n<!-- -->\n<!-- Trailer-->\n<div class=\"TP_Black_line\"><!-- -->\n<div class=\"TP_Trailer\">\n<div class=\"TP_BaseLinks\"><a href=\"http://www.rhul.ac.uk/Campus-Connect/\">Campus Connect</a>\n<div class=\"TP_Base_separator\">\u2022\n<div class=\"TP_BaseLinks\"><a href=\"http://www.rhul.ac.uk/Campus-Intranet/\">Campus Intranet</a>\n<div class=\"TP_Base_separator\">\u2022\n<div class=\"TP_BaseLinks\"><a href=\"http://www.rhul.ac.uk/Staff-Directory/\">Staff Directory</a>\n<div id=\"TP_Trailer\">\n<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name=\"Contact-details\" --><!-- #BeginLibraryItem \"/Computer-Science/Library/Contact-Details.lbi\" --> Department of Computer Science, \nUniversity of London, \nEgham, \nSurrey TW20 0EX<br/>\nTel/Fax : +44 (0)1784 443421/439786\n<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><!-- InstanceEndEditable -->\n\n\n<!-- -->\n<!-- End Container -->"]}
