Conversely, Pearl\u2019s formulas also help identify when correlations can\u2019t be used to determine causation. Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf, who researches causal AI techniques as a director at Germany\u2019s Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, points out that you can predict a country\u2019s birth rate if you know its population of storks. That isn\u2019t because storks deliver babies or because babies attract storks, but probably because economic development leads to more babies and more storks. Pearl has helped give statisticians and computer scientists ways of attacking such problems, Sch\u00f6lkopf says.Pearl\u2019s work has also led to the development of causal Bayesian networks\u2014software that sifts through large amounts of data to detect which variables appear to have the most influence on other variables. For example, GNS Healthcare, a company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, uses these techniques to advise researchers about experiments that look promising. In one project, GNS worked with researchers who study multiple myeloma, a kind of blood cancer. The researchers wanted to know why some patients with the disease live longer than others after getting stem-cell transplants, a common form of treatment. The software churned through data with 30,000 variables and pointed to a few that seemed especially likely to be causal. Biostatisticians and experts in the disease zeroed in on one in particular: the level of a certain protein in patients\u2019 bodies. Researchers could then run a targeted clinical trial to see whether patients with the protein did indeed benefit more from the treatment. \u201cIt\u2019s way faster than poking here and there in the lab,\u201d says GNS cofounder Iya Khalil.One of his systems, which is still in beta, can help scientists determine whether they have sufficient data to answer a causal question. Richard McElreath, an anthropologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, is using the software to guide research into why humans go through menopause (we are the only apes that do).He argues that anyone asking \u201cwhat if\u201d\u2014medical researchers setting up clinical trials, social scientists developing pilot programs, even web publishers preparing A/B tests\u2014should start not merely by gathering data but by using Pearl\u2019s causal logic and software like Bareinboim\u2019s to determine whether the available data could possibly answer a causal hypothesis. Eventually, he envisions this leading to \u201cautomated scientist\u201d software: a human could dream up a causal question to go after, and the software would combine causal inference theory with machine-learning techniques to rule out experiments that wouldn\u2019t answer the question. That might save scientists from a huge number of costly dead ends.That\u2019s an inherently limited approach, he said, because human scientists designing an experiment can consider only a handful of variables in their minds at once. A computer, on the other hand, can see the interplay of hundreds or thousands of variables. Encoded with \u201cthe basic principles\u201d of Pearl\u2019s causal calculus and able to calculate what might happen with new sets of variables, an automated scientist could suggest exactly which experiments the human researchers should spend their time on. Maybe some public policy that has been shown to work only in Texas could be made to work in California if a few causally relevant factors were better appreciated. Scientists would no longer be \u201cdoing experiments in the darkness,\u201d Bareinboim said.  lead author Simona Giacintucci, director of research at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, DC.\u00a0The explosion is now over, according to the radio data."]}
