The center brings together diverse researchers at Columbia in three areas:  (i)  (e.g. ocean and climate science, astrophysics, materials science, civil engineering, physics, biomedical informatics, and computational genomics).  Its goal is to foster new and exciting cross-disciplinary collaborations and research projects between these areas.\n\n", " (July 2016),\nas well as a summary of our recent inaugural symposium (\n", "(covers my main research areas, recent papers, technology transfer, grants) ", "Short Bio (journal style)", "Extended Bio", "Complete CV (September 2019) ", ", in Davis Auditorium, on\n  March 24, 2017, with 150 attendees.
