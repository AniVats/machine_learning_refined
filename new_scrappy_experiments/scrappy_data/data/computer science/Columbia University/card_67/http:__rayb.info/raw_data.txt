I am primarily interested in Software Engineering research with a focus on \n\timproving software reliability and security. In particular, I devise novel \n\tprogram analysis techniques to analyze existing code properties and apply \n\tadvanced machine learning models to learn from those properties. Such models \n\thelp me building tools that automate program development, bug detection, and \n\tprogram repair for real-world large scale software.\n\t\t\n\t\tI am primarily interested in improving software reliability and developers' productivity for traditional and AI-driven software. To know more about my research, please check  Using techniques from diverse domains including machine learning, natural language processing, \n\tand rigorous statistical modeling, I analyze large scale software repositories to understand on-going \n\tsoftware engineering practices. This data-driven knowledge helps me build novel program analysis techniques \n\tand development tools to improve software quality and programmer productivity. \n\tDetails of my research can be found here.
