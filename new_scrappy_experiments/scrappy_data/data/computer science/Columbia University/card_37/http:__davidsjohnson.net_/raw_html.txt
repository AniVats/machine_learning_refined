It accompanied its demand with a petition, endorsed by almost 6,000 people.</p>\n<p>The request from the FSF, whose mission is to promote free software, came on January 23,&nbsp; after the end of the extended support of Windows 7 on January 14. The FSF believes that the end of operating system maintenance should not necessarily mean the termination of the operating system. Perhaps the OS can be given new life by becoming free software.</p>\n<p>Microsoft already made the Windows calculator open source in the spring of 2019. Previously, the Redmond firm also made available to the public the .NET framework, the CNTK machine learning tool, and MS-DOS. These acts have been noticed and appreciated, but their scope is still relatively modest compared to what the company could accomplish.</p>\n<p>Windows 7 was released in October 2009. Standard support for the operating system ended on January 13, 2015. On that date, no new features were available. Then, on January 14, 2020, security patches were discontinued. As for third-party software, updates are also scheduled to be stopped, such as Google Chrome, which will be discontinued in 2021.</p>\n<h2>The proof of love may not arrive</h2>\n<p>Switching to Windows 7 as free software would allow those who can and wish to do so to appropriate an operating system that is considered one of Microsoft\u2019s most successful. In addition to the ability to customize and evolve it, this change in status would potentially entitle it to updates and patches, if the community rolls up its sleeves.</p>\n<p>Microsoft no longer hides its fondness for Linux, but the FSF would like to see a more substantial show of love.</p>\n<p>It is unlikely that Microsoft will satisfy the FSF\u2019s request, at least for the time being, as the group has not yet completely cut the ties with the OS: there is still a paid and specific extended support for businesses, which will be active until January 2023. The group foresees a mechanism to raise the price of services so that companies will be pushed to migrate.</p>\n<p>It is therefore not the day before tomorrow that the free software community will be able to study and modify Windows 7, or even share their changes. That could take years, by the way: as an example, the source code of MS-DOS was only released in 2014, whereas its support ended in\u2026 2001. Assuming the same timeframe is maintained for Windows 7, no release will occur before\u2026 2033.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\n\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n</article><!-- #post-## -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<article id=\"post-107\" class=\"post-content post-107 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-my-blog\">\n\n\t\n\t        <div class=\"featured-image\">\n        \t        \t<a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/new-features-at-ifa-2019-berlins-major-high-tech-trade-fair/\" rel=\"bookmark\">\n            <img src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/future.jpg\" width=\"792\" height=\"458\" class=\"attachment-nisarg-full-width size-nisarg-full-width wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/future.jpg 792w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/future-300x173.jpg 300w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/future-768x444.jpg 768w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/future-467x270.jpg 467w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 792px) 100vw, 792px\"><noscript><img width=\"792\" height=\"458\" src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/future.jpg\" class=\"attachment-nisarg-full-width size-nisarg-full-width wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/future.jpg 792w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/future-300x173.jpg 300w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/future-768x444.jpg 768w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/future-467x270.jpg 467w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 792px) 100vw, 792px\" /></noscript>                        </a>         \n        </div>\n        \n\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\n\t\t<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">New features at IFA 2019, Berlin\u2019s major high-tech trade fair</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"entry-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/new-features-at-ifa-2019-berlins-major-high-tech-trade-fair/\" rel=\"bookmark\">New features at IFA 2019, Berlin\u2019s major high-tech trade fair</a>\n\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t<h5 class=\"entry-date\"><i class=\"fa fa-calendar-o\"></i> <a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/new-features-at-ifa-2019-berlins-major-high-tech-trade-fair/\" title=\"2:02 pm\" rel=\"bookmark\"><time class=\"entry-date\" datetime=\"2019-09-23T14:02:00+00:00\" pubdate=\"\">23rd September 2019 </time></a><span class=\"byline\"><span class=\"sep\"></span><i class=\"fa fa-user\"></i>\n<span class=\"author vcard\"><a class=\"url fn n\" href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/author/administrator/\" title=\"View all posts by David\" rel=\"author\">David</a></span></span></h5>\n\t\t</div><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t\t\t</header><!-- .entry-header -->\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>The IFA was in full swing in Berlin until September 11, allowing visitors to discover the electronic products that will soon be available to them. This 2019 edition focuses on audio, in addition to traditional televisions and household appliances.</p>\n<h2>Samsung Bespoke:&nbsp;a modular refrigerator</h2>\n<p>Samsung has chosen the IFA to announce the release, after many adventures, of its Galaxy Fold folding smartphone, but also that of a 55-inch version of its 8K TV. The Korean has also made a name for himself in the world of large household appliances with his Bespoke refrigerator. A complete range characterized by its modular format \u2013 its elements can be assembled in eight different combinations \u2013 and by its interchangeable colored fronts. However, to know the price, it will still be necessary to wait.</p>\n<h2>TCL&nbsp;gets into the headphones market</h2>\n<p>The TCL brand, whose new televisions were also presented at the IFA, is entering a new segment. It comes with a variety of audio products, from headphones with a hoop to true wireless headphones, some of which offer a sporty version. Models at low prices, since all will cost less than 200 euros.</p>\n<h2>Huawei Freebuds 3: ANC in&nbsp;its true wireless version</h2>\n<p>As every year, Huawei has chosen the IFA to detail the chip that will power his next smartphone, the Mate 30: the Kirin 990 compatible with the 5G. But we will also remember the presentation of its true wireless Freebuds 3 headphones, whose format is not unlike that of the AirPods. Semi-Intra earphones with a promising active noise cancellation system.</p>\n<h2>Sony Xperia 5, delivered with WF-1000XM3 headphones</h2>\n<p>The latest high-end smartphone from Sony is official. An Xperia 5 with a 6.1-inch 21:9 screen, an 855 Snapdragon chipset with 6GB of RAM and a triple back camera.</p>\n<p>A slightly more compact version of the Xperia 1, whose launch price is set at 799 euros for availability from October. Of particular note is the promotional offer offered as part of its pre-orders (as of today), since the smartphone comes with the excellent WF-1000XM3 true wireless headphones, worth 249 euros.</p>\n<h2>Philips PH805: affordable active noise cancellation</h2>\n<p>Discreet in the field of headphones, Philips is back with a promising PH805. Its new lightweight (245g) headband headset with touch-sensitive headphones includes an active noise reduction system. An increasingly common feature on high-end headphones, but which the manufacturer announces at a price of around 200 euros. The affordable ANC, in short.</p>\n<h2>Philips OLED 934+: the integrated Dolby Atmos sound</h2>\n<p>New Philips OLED+ TVs make their debut at the IFA. Among them, the OLED+ 934, including the other Ambilight lighting ranges on three sides and the Android TV operating system. The interest of the device does not stop there: the 4K television is indeed equipped with a soundbar including two speakers facing upwards. A Dolby Atmos-certified system that promises a greater sense of immersion.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\n\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n</article><!-- #post-## -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<article id=\"post-104\" class=\"post-content post-104 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-my-blog\">\n\n\t\n\t        <div class=\"featured-image\">\n        \t        \t<a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wifi-how-to-secure-your-home-network/\" rel=\"bookmark\">\n            <img src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wifi-884x576.jpg\" width=\"884\" height=\"576\" class=\"attachment-nisarg-full-width size-nisarg-full-width wp-post-image\" alt=\"\"><noscript><img width=\"884\" height=\"576\" src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wifi-884x576.jpg\" class=\"attachment-nisarg-full-width size-nisarg-full-width wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" /></noscript>                        </a>         \n        </div>\n        \n\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\n\t\t<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">WiFi: how to secure your home network</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"entry-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wifi-how-to-secure-your-home-network/\" rel=\"bookmark\">WiFi: how to secure your home network</a>\n\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t<h5 class=\"entry-date\"><i class=\"fa fa-calendar-o\"></i> <a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wifi-how-to-secure-your-home-network/\" title=\"12:31 pm\" rel=\"bookmark\"><time class=\"entry-date\" datetime=\"2019-05-02T12:31:00+00:00\" pubdate=\"\">2nd May 2019 </time></a><span class=\"byline\"><span class=\"sep\"></span><i class=\"fa fa-user\"></i>\n<span class=\"author vcard\"><a class=\"url fn n\" href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/author/administrator/\" title=\"View all posts by David\" rel=\"author\">David</a></span></span></h5>\n\t\t</div><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t\t\t</header><!-- .entry-header -->\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>WiFi networks have become the norm, but they pose some security challenges: they can allow an intruder to access your network, the machines connected to it, and their traffic. A malicious person can conduct his attack from a distance, in complete discretion. However, strengthening the security of your WiFi network is not just about changing your network key, as you will see. Here are some tips to improve the protection of your network against possible intrusions.</p>\n<h2>Change the name of your SSID network</h2>\n<p>By default, your internet box diffuses a name that betrays its origin. Each operator has its name, so this gives an essential indication to a potential hacker who will try to exploit a flaw in your hardware.</p>\n<p>Why not try to confuse everyone instead? Choose a different name \u2013 whether it\u2019s something that has absolutely nothing to do with it, or why not a name that looks like another operator\u2019s box. It will not improve your security, but it will undoubtedly waste some time for a potential hacker.</p>\n<h2>Keep your router up to date</h2>\n<p>It goes without saying that if there are loopholes, manufacturers tend to fix them and offer regular updates. However, the update is not always automatic on all models. You must, therefore, connect to your administration space.</p>\n<h2>Choose a strong password for your WiFi network</h2>\n<p>In general, your operator\u2019s box manages your WiFi network. It means that in general, your operator has already assigned you a very complicated connection key that does not have to be changed. Unless your box is in common areas and you want to prevent anyone from connecting with the code pasted on the box label.</p>\n<p>Anyway, if you change it, opt for something that is both mnemonic and secure. In this article, we give you some wise advice on choosing better passwords. One of them is to build your passwords as sentences (sequences of pronounceable words) rather than a series of numbers, letters, and special characters.</p>\n<h2>Choose the highest encryption compatible with your devices</h2>\n<p>WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) is the oldest encryption method \u2013 and is now almost as recommended as leaving your network without a password (whether in 64 or 128-bit version). It is a method to be avoided in any case.</p>\n<p>WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) is a series of standards designed to improve security. WPA I was quickly superseded by WPA2, and more recently, after the discovery of critical protocol vulnerabilities, the WiFi Alliance launched WPA3. The problem is that this last technology is still slow to become more democratic.</p>\n<p>TKIP is the old encryption method used by the WPA protocol.</p>\n<p>AES is a secure encryption standard used by the military and others.</p>\n<p>The WPA/WPA2-PSK (TKIP+AES) mode is not, contrary to popular belief, the most secure method available on your router. This hybrid mode combines the two versions of WPA and encryption protocols (TKIP and AES) for more excellent compatibility. However, it allows hackers to take advantage of the vulnerabilities of the WPA I protocol \u2013 knowing that the WPA 2 protocol is now vulnerable too. And it also allows you to use TKIP, less secure encryption than AES.</p>\n<p>Therefore, if your devices allow it, we recommend that you choose the WPA2-PSK (AES) mode on your router since WPA3 is still slow to appear.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\n\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n</article><!-- #post-## -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<article id=\"post-99\" class=\"post-content post-99 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-appliances\">\n\n\t\n\t        <div class=\"featured-image\">\n        \t        \t<a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/basics-foldable-smartphone-tech-explained/\" rel=\"bookmark\">\n            <img src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Foldable-Smartphone-tech.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\" class=\"attachment-nisarg-full-width size-nisarg-full-width wp-post-image\" alt=\"Foldable Smartphone tech\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Foldable-Smartphone-tech.jpg 768w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Foldable-Smartphone-tech-300x169.jpg 300w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Foldable-Smartphone-tech-480x270.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\"><noscript><img width=\"768\" height=\"432\" src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Foldable-Smartphone-tech.jpg\" class=\"attachment-nisarg-full-width size-nisarg-full-width wp-post-image\" alt=\"Foldable Smartphone tech\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Foldable-Smartphone-tech.jpg 768w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Foldable-Smartphone-tech-300x169.jpg 300w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Foldable-Smartphone-tech-480x270.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></noscript>                        </a>         \n        </div>\n        \n\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\n\t\t<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">The Basics Of Foldable Smartphone Tech Explained</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"entry-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/basics-foldable-smartphone-tech-explained/\" rel=\"bookmark\">The Basics Of Foldable Smartphone Tech Explained</a>\n\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t<h5 class=\"entry-date\"><i class=\"fa fa-calendar-o\"></i> <a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/basics-foldable-smartphone-tech-explained/\" title=\"8:37 am\" rel=\"bookmark\"><time class=\"entry-date\" datetime=\"2019-03-11T08:37:24+00:00\" pubdate=\"\">11th March 2019 </time></a><span class=\"byline\"><span class=\"sep\"></span><i class=\"fa fa-user\"></i>\n<span class=\"author vcard\"><a class=\"url fn n\" href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/author/administrator/\" title=\"View all posts by David\" rel=\"author\">David</a></span></span></h5>\n\t\t</div><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t\t\t</header><!-- .entry-header -->\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>Were you amazed when you caught a glimpse of the new foldable smartphone tech? If these phones astonished you, you might have some questions. How do these phones work? How is this possible? What is it like to use these phones? If you\u2019re trying to find a way to satisfy your curiosity, there are a few things that you can try.</p>\n<h2>The Parts Used For Smartphones Are Smaller Than Ever</h2>\n<p>One of the reasons that this sort of tech wasn\u2019t possible in the past was because of the size of the parts used to make phones. Because the parts were on the larger side, it wasn\u2019t possible to make phones that were thin enough to be easily folded up.</p>\n<p>However, over the years, the parts that we use to make smartphones have grown and smaller and smaller. Although some of the phones on the market right now do have large screens, most newer phones are on the thinner side. Small parts make it possible to make phones that we wouldn\u2019t have been able to produce in the past. It\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll see phones develop in more ways in the years to come.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dual-screen-smartphones.png\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-101\" alt=\"dual screen smartphones\" width=\"334\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dual-screen-smartphones.png 508w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dual-screen-smartphones-300x202.png 300w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dual-screen-smartphones-401x270.png 401w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 334px) 100vw, 334px\"><noscript><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-101\" src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dual-screen-smartphones.png\" alt=\"dual screen smartphones\" width=\"334\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dual-screen-smartphones.png 508w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dual-screen-smartphones-300x202.png 300w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dual-screen-smartphones-401x270.png 401w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 334px) 100vw, 334px\" /></noscript></p>\n<h2>These Phones Can Rival Standard Smartphones</h2>\n<p>You might be concerned that a foldable phone won\u2019t be able to do the things that your current phone will. While some phones are more powerful than others, you won\u2019t be making a sacrifice if you decide to switch to a foldable phone. Some of the available models are among the most powerful smartphones on the market.</p>\n<p>If you miss the convenience of old flip phones but don\u2019t want to give up the perks that you\u2019re getting from the smartphone you\u2019re using now, then this is the solution that you\u2019ve been looking for. If you look at the specs of some of these phones, you\u2019ll be blown away.</p>\n<h2>The Newest Smartphones Are Very Different From Old Flip Phones</h2>\n<p>The new foldable phones that we see from companies like Samsung might seem like they\u2019re similar to old-fashioned flip phones. Even though these phones might have some fundamental visual similarities, they are very different products when it comes down to it.</p>\n<p>How are these phones different? First of all, these phones are capable of doing all kinds of things that older phones wouldn\u2019t have been able to do. These new phones are incredibly powerful and offer all of the perks that you\u2019d expect a modern smartphone to have.</p>\n<p>These phones are also a lot slimmer and lighter than old flip phones. When you see one of these phones in person, you\u2019ll be able to see how thin and sleek they are. This is a very stylish type of phone that can fit in a tiny pocket.</p>\n<p>You should take the time to find out more about foldable smartphone tech. Don\u2019t be afraid to look beyond the basics.

It is a volume \u2013 like a hard disk \u2013 network, which can be accessible by everyone in your home or even outside. It is a mini-server.</p>\n<p>You can then create users and user groups. You can configure different shares, volumes, which will be network disks, to limit access to specific data for individual users. Thus, the child will not have access to videos shot with mom, and mom will not have access to your collection of personal movies.</p>\n<p>Beyond this \u201caccess security\u201d aspect, a NAS very often has the advantage of having several hard drives, and of providing redundancy for your data. It is not a backup solution as such, but significant protection against hardware failures.</p>\n<h2>Why do you need it?</h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_95\" style=\"width: 227px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a-western-digital-NAS.png\" class=\"wp-image-95\" alt=\"a western digital NAS\" width=\"227\" height=\"217\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a-western-digital-NAS.png 582w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a-western-digital-NAS-300x287.png 300w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a-western-digital-NAS-283x270.png 283w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 227px) 100vw, 227px\"><noscript><img class=\"wp-image-95\" src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a-western-digital-NAS.png\" alt=\"a western digital NAS\" width=\"227\" height=\"217\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a-western-digital-NAS.png 582w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a-western-digital-NAS-300x287.png 300w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a-western-digital-NAS-283x270.png 283w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 227px) 100vw, 227px\" /></noscript><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">A western digital NAS</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As mentioned above, the centralization and security of data are the biggest arguments for buying a NAS. Beyond that, since a NAS is a tiny server, you can do a lot of things.</p>\n<p>The first of these is to outsource the downloading of your files to the NAS, instead of doing it on your computer.</p>\n<p>For your collection of movies, you can use an application like Plex to play your media on TV. You can even play them on a smartphone away from home as long as you have an internet connection. Quite honestly, it\u2019s part of the uses that have changed my digital life, and I won\u2019t go back for anything in the world.</p>\n<p>You can use your NAS server as a camera surveillance server, publish web content, print files from your tablet. It\u2019s a new world that you will discover</p>\n<h2>Which NAS to buy?</h2>\n<p>I can\u2019t advise you to buy a single bay model, which won\u2019t protect you against hardware failures (no RAID). I would recommend the Synology or Qnap brand, for the power of their solutions, their beautiful design, and their regular updates.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>I hope I\u2019ve covered the subject of NAS servers and their use-cases as well as usefulness. I do not deliberately go into the details of everything that can be done, but you can find more on the web learn more about this technology.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\n\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n</article><!-- #post-## -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<article id=\"post-85\" class=\"post-content post-85 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-my-blog\">\n\n\t\n\t        <div class=\"featured-image\">\n        \t        \t<a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/what-is-a-blockchain/\" rel=\"bookmark\">\n            <img src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/blockchain-explained.jpeg\" width=\"269\" height=\"188\" class=\"attachment-nisarg-full-width size-nisarg-full-width wp-post-image\" alt=\"\"><noscript><img width=\"269\" height=\"188\" src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/blockchain-explained.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-nisarg-full-width size-nisarg-full-width wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" /></noscript>                        </a>         \n        </div>\n        \n\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\n\t\t<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">What is a blockchain?</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"entry-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/what-is-a-blockchain/\" rel=\"bookmark\">What is a blockchain?</a>\n\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t<h5 class=\"entry-date\"><i class=\"fa fa-calendar-o\"></i> <a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/what-is-a-blockchain/\" title=\"7:51 am\" rel=\"bookmark\"><time class=\"entry-date\" datetime=\"2018-10-06T07:51:00+00:00\" pubdate=\"\">6th October 2018 </time></a><span class=\"byline\"><span class=\"sep\"></span><i class=\"fa fa-user\"></i>\n<span class=\"author vcard\"><a class=\"url fn n\" href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/author/administrator/\" title=\"View all posts by David\" rel=\"author\">David</a></span></span></h5>\n\t\t</div><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t\t\t</header><!-- .entry-header -->\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>For some time now, the term blockchain has been emerging on the web and elsewhere, but it is not always easy for some to have a clear idea of what it represents.</p>\n<h2>The idea of construction and operation is quite simple.</h2>\n<p>The latter is a means of transmitting, storing, and verifying information in a mathematical and entirely decentralized way.</p>\n<p>Let us take a notary as a counter-example. The latter is a trusted and recognized individual who confers (in exchange for payment) on the acts you ask for a pledge of authenticity through his signature.</p>\n<p>However, everything is based on this so-called trust that you and others have in him and without which the acts would no longer be of any value. Not only is it theoretically possible for him to lie and validate a litigious act, but it is also conceivable for other individuals to copy his seal and signature to authenticate forgeries.</p>\n<h2>A revolutionary technological breakthrough</h2>\n<p>The way the blockchain works is revolutionary in the sense that no trusted third party is necessary and falsification of acts is impossible. The blockchain network is made up of multiple individuals called miners (now several hundred thousand) who are responsible for validating the latter which are in a block by mathematical proof. Once the block is approved, it is linked to the previous ones.</p>\n<p>It is not possible for minors to falsify a transaction because, as a result of decentralization, if one of them decides to lie by validating an illegal operation, the others will invalidate it later. Each person can play the role of the miner, thus guaranteeing the neutrality of the network.</p>\n<p>Nor is it feasible for a person to do an invalid act as something that is validated because the blocks containing the authentic acts are visible to all. Indeed, each person participating in the network downloads all the blocks (and therefore the acts) since the creation of the network. <br>Miners get blockchain transaction fees that each person who wishes to enter something in the blockchain must pay (the average fees are generally meager, the equivalent of $0.05 for some cryptos), but also by creating new tokens (or cryptocurrencies) that they can then sell. Indeed, it is the latter that will be used to pay future transaction costs.</p>\n<p>Multiple applications of the blockchain are possible, the most famous being its use for crypto-currencies. The first application of the blockchain is bitcoin.</p>\n<h2>Operation in summary:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Jane wants to send 1 Bitcoin to John. She deposits her transaction in a pool (which contains all transactions pending validation) and deposits a \u201ctip\u201d (transaction fee) for minors.</li>\n<li>Miners select from the pool the transactions with the most tips and then put them in a block.</li>\n<li>The block is then validated using cryptographic means thanks to the work of the latter. They receive tips and new coins created during this process (ensuring the circulation of new cash).</li>\n<li>The block is registered in the blockchain, and anyone can, therefore, see the transactions present in this block (unless the blockchain is private).</li>\n<li>John received his Bitcoin because the network validated Jane\u2019s shipment and entered \u201c+1 BTC\u201d in John\u2019s wallet.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of course, an infinite number of applications are conceivable, such as a decentralized supercomputer, a secure cloud, or even a new Internet. The operation described above will remain the same if blockchains with a different security principle, the Proof-Of-Stake, are introduced. We will not be interested in it in this article.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\n\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n</article><!-- #post-## -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<article id=\"post-82\" class=\"post-content post-82 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-appliances\">\n\n\t\n\t        <div class=\"featured-image\">\n        \t        \t<a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/virtual-reality-how-does-it-works/\" rel=\"bookmark\">\n            <img src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/vr-reality-headsets.jpg\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\" class=\"attachment-nisarg-full-width size-nisarg-full-width wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/vr-reality-headsets.jpg 750w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/vr-reality-headsets-300x200.jpg 300w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/vr-reality-headsets-405x270.jpg 405w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\"><noscript><img width=\"750\" height=\"500\" src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/vr-reality-headsets.jpg\" class=\"attachment-nisarg-full-width size-nisarg-full-width wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/vr-reality-headsets.jpg 750w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/vr-reality-headsets-300x200.jpg 300w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/vr-reality-headsets-405x270.jpg 405w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></noscript>                        </a>         \n        </div>\n        \n\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\n\t\t<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Virtual Reality, How Does it Works?</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"entry-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/virtual-reality-how-does-it-works/\" rel=\"bookmark\">Virtual Reality, How Does it Works?</a>\n\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t<h5 class=\"entry-date\"><i class=\"fa fa-calendar-o\"></i> <a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/virtual-reality-how-does-it-works/\" title=\"1:52 pm\" rel=\"bookmark\"><time class=\"entry-date\" datetime=\"2018-07-03T13:52:00+00:00\" pubdate=\"\">3rd July 2018 </time></a><span class=\"byline\"><span class=\"sep\"></span><i class=\"fa fa-user\"></i>\n<span class=\"author vcard\"><a class=\"url fn n\" href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/author/administrator/\" title=\"View all posts by David\" rel=\"author\">David</a></span></span></h5>\n\t\t</div><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t\t\t</header><!-- .entry-header -->\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>Virtual reality works around 5 main components.</p>\n<p>. The Head Mounted Display headset: It is the component at the heart of the visual immersion sensation, thanks to a system based on two screens, one for each eye, allowing the depth of the field of vision to be streamed.</p>\n<p>. The joysticks: In the virtual world, the controllers are like your hands, allowing you to interact with the environment. They thus actively contribute to the feeling of touch.</p>\n<p>. Motion sensors: These are the sensors that make it possible to follow the exact position of the helmet and controllers, and thus to offer the sensation of movement and life-size immersion.</p>\n<p>. The audio system: It has a dual characteristic. First of all, it allows sensory immersion by transcribing the sounds from the VR experience. On the other hand, it allows communication with other players, which is essential for a collaborative adventure.</p>\n<p>. The computer: Its role is preponderant because it must be correctly dimensioned to meet the needs of the RV, in particular, to ensure a refresh rate of at least 90 frames per second.</p>\n<h2>Definition</h2>\n<p>Virtual reality is a relatively old concept, even if its name is somewhat recent. The terms \u201cimmersive multimedia\u201d and \u201csimulated computer reality\u201d can be considered synonyms. A definition that has been popularized would read: \u201cA set of computer techniques used to simulate the physical presence of a user in a virtual universe artificially created by various devices and software.</p>\n<p>Virtual reality will thus make its user live a visual experience of immersion in a world and a universe created digitally. These universes can be entirely imaginary and drawn from the minds of their creators, but they can also be partial or complete representations of real places, drawn from real life.</p>\n<h3>A little history</h3>\n<p>The first traces of the evocation of virtual reality in its present sense date back to the mid-1930s, with Stanley G. Weinbaum. The latter published a short story in which he speaks explicitly of a pair of glasses allowing the wearer to have the impression of being transported into a virtual universe in which he can interact, touch and feel things.</p>\n<p>In the real world, the first research on virtual reality dates back to the 1950s\u2032. At that time, Morton Heilig, creator, and inventor was working on an entertainment concept that would stimulate the spectator\u2019s senses to deceive his mind and make him believe that he was evolving in a different universe from the real world. In the early 60\u2019s, after a decade of research and testing, Morton introduced the Sensorama. At that time, digital did not exist. The Sensorama is, therefore, a mechanical device that transports its user into an artificially created universe. Morton offered 5 short films compatible with his system, which marked the beginning of the RV concept.</p>\n<p>During the same period, the U.S. military became interested in the RV concept to adapt it to a flight simulator.</p>\n<h3>HTC Vive, best VR handset hands up!</h3>\n<p>David Johnson chose the VIVE technology developed by the Taiwanese company HTC.</p>\n<p>The HTC Vive headset, equipped with 32 sensors for 360\u00b0 motion tracking, delivers stunning image quality with a resolution of 2160 x 1200 pixels. It offers total visual immersion thanks to a 110\u00b0 field of view. It is also very comfortable to wear thanks to foam cushions and nose pads that offer personalized comfort. It is particularly suitable for most pairs of glasses.</p>\n<p>Thanks to its 2 controllers, each with 24 detectors, the HTC Vive offers accurate motion tracking for perfect interaction with the environment.</p>\n<p>As for its exclusive integrated audio system, it allows sound and image to be perfectly synchronized for an enhanced immersive effect.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\n\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n</article><!-- #post-## -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<article id=\"post-74\" class=\"post-content post-74 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-appliances\">\n\n\t\n\t        <div class=\"featured-image\">\n        \t        \t<a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/apple-watch-3-presentation/\" rel=\"bookmark\">\n            <img src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/apple-keynote-presentation.png\" width=\"772\" height=\"440\" class=\"attachment-nisarg-full-width size-nisarg-full-width wp-post-image\" alt=\"apple keynote presentation\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/apple-keynote-presentation.png 772w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/apple-keynote-presentation-300x171.png 300w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/apple-keynote-presentation-768x438.png 768w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/apple-keynote-presentation-474x270.png 474w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 772px) 100vw, 772px\"><noscript><img width=\"772\" height=\"440\" src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/apple-keynote-presentation.png\" class=\"attachment-nisarg-full-width size-nisarg-full-width wp-post-image\" alt=\"apple keynote presentation\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/apple-keynote-presentation.png 772w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/apple-keynote-presentation-300x171.png 300w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/apple-keynote-presentation-768x438.png 768w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/apple-keynote-presentation-474x270.png 474w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 772px) 100vw, 772px\" /></noscript>                        </a>         \n        </div>\n        \n\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\n\t\t<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Apple Watch 3 Presentation</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"entry-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/apple-watch-3-presentation/\" rel=\"bookmark\">Apple Watch 3 Presentation</a>\n\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t<h5 class=\"entry-date\"><i class=\"fa fa-calendar-o\"></i> <a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/apple-watch-3-presentation/\" title=\"9:00 am\" rel=\"bookmark\"><time class=\"entry-date\" datetime=\"2017-10-15T09:00:26+00:00\" pubdate=\"\">15th October 2017 </time></a><span class=\"byline\"><span class=\"sep\"></span><i class=\"fa fa-user\"></i>\n<span class=\"author vcard\"><a class=\"url fn n\" href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/author/administrator/\" title=\"View all posts by David\" rel=\"author\">David</a></span></span></h5>\n\t\t</div><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t\t\t</header><!-- .entry-header -->\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>Released on September 22nd, 2017, the Apple Watch 3 signals the arrival of a 4G module, allowing the connected watch to be independent of the smartphone. A sufficient novelty? Our test.<br>\nApple signs its third generation of watches connected with the Apple Watch 3.<br>\nLess than three years after the release of the first model, the American giant finally endows its product with a 4G connection, allowing it to emancipate itself from the iPhone. If in the design, the Apple brand lacks originality, the latter has bet everything on its new S3 processor.</p>\n<h2>Always the same design</h2>\n<p><img src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/make-phone-calls-from-the-watch-150x150.png\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-76\" alt=\"make phone calls from the watch\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\"><noscript><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-76\" src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/make-phone-calls-from-the-watch-150x150.png\" alt=\"make phone calls from the watch\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></noscript>Apple doesn\u2019t make any revolution in design. The Apple Watch 3 is similar to the older models with a rectangular case (38 or 42 mm). Only one change distinguishes it from the others: its red dial\u2026 You will have understood that the biggest changes reside inside the connected watch.</p>\n<h3>The 4G module changes the game.</h3>\n<p>The latest connected Apple watch has the new S3 chip. The latter is much more responsive than its elders and offers a more enjoyable experience and more frequent use.</p>\n<p>The Apple Watch 3 also features WatchOS 4, its new operating system, which offers new features such as chatting with Siri. On previous versions of the accessory, the apple giant\u2019s boot displayed only messages on the screen. From now on, the personal assistant speaks, writes our messages and even schedules calls.</p>\n<p>But the biggest new feature of the Apple Watch 3 is its 4G module. The watch can now be independent of the smartphone. In short, it no longer has to be connected to the iPhone to send messages, use apps or make calls. It is very good news for those who don\u2019t want to be constantly cluttered with their phones, but also for sportsmen and women who can now use Apple Music or another streaming platform via Watch.</p>\n<p>However, this cellular connection is only accessible under certain conditions. To begin with, you must at least own an iPhone 5SE and secondly, you must be the lucky owner of an Orange subscription with a multi-SIM option\u2026 Apple is only working with one operator at the moment, but others will soon be available.</p>\n<p>The connection can still be improved. As soon as it disconnects from the iPhone or wi-fi to enter a cellular connection, it takes about 30 seconds of adaptation, the same as when you leave the subway or an area without a network. But on the whole, it\u2019s still honorable.</p>\n<h4>A watch dedicated to sportsmen and women</h4>\n<p>Since its launch, the Apple Watch has seduced sports enthusiasts with its many functionalities. But the third generation is doing even more. It incorporates a more precise cardiac sensor, which can be adjusted to alert you when your pulse exceeds a certain level, an improved Exercise application that timed your run, takes heartbeats and distance traveled in different disciplines. The latter is also water-resistant to 50 meters.<img src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/new-Apple-Watch-3-150x150.png\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-75\" alt=\"new Apple Watch 3\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\"><noscript><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-75\" src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/new-Apple-Watch-3-150x150.png\" alt=\"new Apple Watch 3\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></noscript></p>\n<p>It also has the Activity application, which offers more advanced data and a ring system that allows you to reach several objectives during the day. Alerts also prompt you to carry them out if they are not reached. Finally, the fact that you don\u2019t need an iPhone is very beneficial: you don\u2019t have to worry about having to listen to music, send messages or receive calls.</p>\n<h4>An accessory that has a price tag\u2026like every Apple product!</h4>\n<p>Like all Apple products, you\u2019ll have to get your hands on the Apple Watch 3. Count 449 euros for the starting version with 4G. Add to that 5 euros per month for an Orange package, -the first six months are free. Without the 4G, the model goes down to 369 euros but loses all the innovative aspect of the third-generation model.</p>\n<p>Apple is here signaling a good evolution of its product with an independently connected watch. More powerful, faster and more powerful, this one is innovative for those who don\u2019t own an Apple Watch. Owners of one of the previous models can also purchase it if they wish to benefit from the autonomy of the product. However, we regret that the design has not evolved\u2026 All that remains is to customize your watch with new bracelets.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/huge-range-of-colours-avail.png\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-78\" alt=\"huge range of colours avail\" width=\"350\" height=\"252\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/huge-range-of-colours-avail.png 350w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/huge-range-of-colours-avail-300x216.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\"><noscript><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-78\" src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/huge-range-of-colours-avail.png\" alt=\"huge range of colours avail\" width=\"350\" height=\"252\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/huge-range-of-colours-avail.png 350w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/huge-range-of-colours-avail-300x216.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" /></noscript></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\n\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n</article><!-- #post-## -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<article id=\"post-68\" class=\"post-content post-68 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-my-blog\">\n\n\t\n\t        <div class=\"featured-image\">\n        \t        \t<a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/clean-mac-ultimate-tool-clean-apple-computer/\" rel=\"bookmark\">\n            <img src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/review-of-clean-my-mac-software.png\" width=\"591\" height=\"349\" class=\"attachment-nisarg-full-width size-nisarg-full-width wp-post-image\" alt=\"review of clean my mac software\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/review-of-clean-my-mac-software.png 591w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/review-of-clean-my-mac-software-300x177.png 300w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/review-of-clean-my-mac-software-457x270.png 457w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px\"><noscript><img width=\"591\" height=\"349\" src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/review-of-clean-my-mac-software.png\" class=\"attachment-nisarg-full-width size-nisarg-full-width wp-post-image\" alt=\"review of clean my mac software\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/review-of-clean-my-mac-software.png 591w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/review-of-clean-my-mac-software-300x177.png 300w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/review-of-clean-my-mac-software-457x270.png 457w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px\" /></noscript>                        </a>         \n        </div>\n        \n\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\n\t\t<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Clean My Mac \u2013 The Ultimate Tool to Clean your Apple Computer!</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"entry-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/clean-mac-ultimate-tool-clean-apple-computer/\" rel=\"bookmark\">Clean My Mac \u2013 The Ultimate Tool to Clean your Apple Computer!</a>\n\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t<h5 class=\"entry-date\"><i class=\"fa fa-calendar-o\"></i> <a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/clean-mac-ultimate-tool-clean-apple-computer/\" title=\"9:50 am\" rel=\"bookmark\"><time class=\"entry-date\" datetime=\"2017-06-07T09:50:42+00:00\" pubdate=\"\">7th June 2017 </time></a><span class=\"byline\"><span class=\"sep\"></span><i class=\"fa fa-user\"></i>\n<span class=\"author vcard\"><a class=\"url fn n\" href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/author/administrator/\" title=\"View all posts by David\" rel=\"author\">David</a></span></span></h5>\n\t\t</div><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t\t\t</header><!-- .entry-header -->\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>A new major version of CleanMyMac, not to be confused with MacKeeper, is available.

class=\"entry-content\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>Long used by the military, drones are now used by private individuals for both recreational and commercial use.</p>\n<h2>How do they really work?</h2>\n<p>Generally speaking, a drone is characterized by 4,6 or 8 propellers.</p>\n<p>The propeller blades of a drone are fixed, in fact, they can not change angle of inclination. The rotation of the propeller blades is alternated. In the meantime, the alternating inversion of these propellers promotes flight stability.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bebop-2-parrot.png\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-62\" alt=\"bebop 2 parrot\" width=\"581\" height=\"396\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bebop-2-parrot.png 770w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bebop-2-parrot-300x205.png 300w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bebop-2-parrot-768x524.png 768w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bebop-2-parrot-396x270.png 396w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 581px) 100vw, 581px\"><noscript><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-62\" src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bebop-2-parrot.png\" alt=\"bebop 2 parrot\" width=\"581\" height=\"396\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bebop-2-parrot.png 770w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bebop-2-parrot-300x205.png 300w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bebop-2-parrot-768x524.png 768w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bebop-2-parrot-396x270.png 396w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 581px) 100vw, 581px\" /></noscript></p>\n<p>The principle of flight is based solely on the movement of the propellers. If all engines run at the same speed, the drone will hover.</p>\n<p>To make a movement, advance or back up, the success of the flight is played on the front and rear engines. Similarly, for the right and left movement of the arms. The slowing of the right engines favors the movement to the right. To rotate, increase the speed of motors aligned on an axis. In addition, a drone is also equipped with several technologies. It is powered by an electrical power namely polymer lithium batteries.</p>\n<h3>How to control the navigation?</h3>\n<p>The control of a drone requires a particular technique that the individual must learn. Like other flying machines, drones move in the air. The blades of the propellers allow it to perform the flight. Thanks to navigation electronics, you can control a drone from the ground.</p>\n<p>The latter obeys you with the finger and the eye. Using a specific device called a radio controller, you can easily influence the movements made by your multirotor. Then the barometer accurately measures the altitude traveled by this flying device.</p>\n<p>Finally, using a GPS, you can easily detect the position of your drone.

While it is clear that vaporizers have existed for a long time, it was not until the last five to ten years ago that their importance came to people\u2019s knowledge.</p>\n<h2>How do cannabis vaporizers work?</h2>\n<p>The main benefit of vaporizing marijuana is to remove the potentially health-inhibiting factors in the product. With proper vaporizing, you can avoid some of the health issues associated with using marijuana. Some of these issues include the presence of carcinogens and tar in the cannabis. During the vaporizing process, cannabis heats to a level where only the desired cannabinoids are released without hampering the main material.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/replace-toxic-chemicals-in-tobacco.png\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-53\" alt=\"replace toxic chemicals in tobacco\" width=\"398\" height=\"236\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/replace-toxic-chemicals-in-tobacco.png 398w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/replace-toxic-chemicals-in-tobacco-300x178.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px\"><noscript><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-53\" src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/replace-toxic-chemicals-in-tobacco.png\" alt=\"replace toxic chemicals in tobacco\" width=\"398\" height=\"236\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/replace-toxic-chemicals-in-tobacco.png 398w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/replace-toxic-chemicals-in-tobacco-300x178.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px\" /></noscript></p>\n<h3>What are the types of the available vaporizers?</h3>\n<p>Currently, there are three types of cannabis vaporizers. They include:</p>\n<p><strong>Pen vaporizers</strong><br>\nAs their name suggests, pen vaporizers (\u201cVape pens\u201d) assume the shape of a normal pen. Some of the benefits of using this type of vaporizers include the fact that they are easy to use, allows for discretion and are much cheaper as compared to the other types.</p>\n<p><strong>Portable vaporizers</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/various-Medical-Marijuana-applications.png\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-54\" alt=\"various Medical Marijuana applications\" width=\"316\" height=\"235\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/various-Medical-Marijuana-applications.png 316w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/various-Medical-Marijuana-applications-300x223.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 316px) 100vw, 316px\"><noscript><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-54\" src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/various-Medical-Marijuana-applications.png\" alt=\"various Medical Marijuana applications\" width=\"316\" height=\"235\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/various-Medical-Marijuana-applications.png 316w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/various-Medical-Marijuana-applications-300x223.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 316px) 100vw, 316px\" /></noscript>As technology advances, so do this type of vaporizers. The main advantage of these vaporizers is that they are portable thereby they enhance convenience. In addition to that, they are slightly larger than pen vaporizers, and they are rechargeable.

Despite the fact that they are not portable, these kinds of vaporizers have more benefits as compared to the other types. They deliver a higher quality vapor, and they use the convection method of heating.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>Cannabis vaporizers work by heating cannabis to a level just below its combustion point. It ensures that the much-needed cannabinoids are extracted without destroying the material. There are three types of cannabis vaporizers namely desktop, portable and pen vaporizers. All these works to perform the same functions differently.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\n\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n</article><!-- #post-## -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<article id=\"post-46\" class=\"post-content post-46 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-appliances\">\n\n\t\n\t        <div class=\"featured-image\">\n        \t        \t<a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/smart-watches-work/\" rel=\"bookmark\">\n            <img src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/wide-range-of-smart-watches-available-on-the-market.png\" width=\"864\" height=\"461\" class=\"attachment-nisarg-full-width size-nisarg-full-width wp-post-image\" alt=\"wide range of smart watches available on the market\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/wide-range-of-smart-watches-available-on-the-market.png 864w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/wide-range-of-smart-watches-available-on-the-market-300x160.png 300w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/wide-range-of-smart-watches-available-on-the-market-768x410.png 768w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/wide-range-of-smart-watches-available-on-the-market-506x270.png 506w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px\"><noscript><img width=\"864\" height=\"461\" src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/wide-range-of-smart-watches-available-on-the-market.png\" class=\"attachment-nisarg-full-width size-nisarg-full-width wp-post-image\" alt=\"wide range of smart watches available on the market\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/wide-range-of-smart-watches-available-on-the-market.png 864w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/wide-range-of-smart-watches-available-on-the-market-300x160.png 300w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/wide-range-of-smart-watches-available-on-the-market-768x410.png 768w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/wide-range-of-smart-watches-available-on-the-market-506x270.png 506w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px\" /></noscript>                        </a>         \n        </div>\n        \n\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\n\t\t<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">How Smart Watches Work</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"entry-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/smart-watches-work/\" rel=\"bookmark\">How Smart Watches Work</a>\n\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t<h5 class=\"entry-date\"><i class=\"fa fa-calendar-o\"></i> <a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/smart-watches-work/\" title=\"5:23 am\" rel=\"bookmark\"><time class=\"entry-date\" datetime=\"2017-04-19T05:23:57+00:00\" pubdate=\"\">19th April 2017 </time></a><span class=\"byline\"><span class=\"sep\"></span><i class=\"fa fa-user\"></i>\n<span class=\"author vcard\"><a class=\"url fn n\" href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/author/administrator/\" title=\"View all posts by David\" rel=\"author\">David</a></span></span></h5>\n\t\t</div><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t\t\t</header><!-- .entry-header -->\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>Researchers working in the field of high technology have not finished producing the most innovative results yet.

First, it receives all notifications from your phone without the need to take the mobile out of your pocket or bag.</p>\n<p>In this case, they are primarily mobile phone assistants. Some watches allow for more extensive use. Most of them allow you to receive or make calls, read emails or SMS, or access various social networks. Some models have an integrated camera allowing video capture sequences.</p>\n<p>GPS and multimedia functions are also part of the strengths of a few watches. The vast majority of connected watches are equipped with a touch screen for easier and more intuitive use. The biggest worry at the moment is the relatively short battery life. The arrival of the Android and soon iOS blinds should multiply the applications available, as well in declination of those existing already on the smartphones as for other domains.</p>\n<p>Health and fitness seem to be the most promising sectors right now.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXwn62DvAkw\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\n\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n</article><!-- #post-## -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<article id=\"post-39\" class=\"post-content post-39 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-appliances\">\n\n\t\n\t        <div class=\"featured-image\">\n        \t        \t<a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/steam-cleaner/\" rel=\"bookmark\">\n            <img src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/a-clean-house-any-time.png\" width=\"799\" height=\"464\" class=\"attachment-nisarg-full-width size-nisarg-full-width wp-post-image\" alt=\"a clean house any time\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/a-clean-house-any-time.png 799w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/a-clean-house-any-time-300x174.png 300w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/a-clean-house-any-time-768x446.png 768w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/a-clean-house-any-time-465x270.png 465w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 799px) 100vw, 799px\"><noscript><img width=\"799\" height=\"464\" src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/a-clean-house-any-time.png\" class=\"attachment-nisarg-full-width size-nisarg-full-width wp-post-image\" alt=\"a clean house any time\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/a-clean-house-any-time.png 799w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/a-clean-house-any-time-300x174.png 300w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/a-clean-house-any-time-768x446.png 768w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/a-clean-house-any-time-465x270.png 465w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 799px) 100vw, 799px\" /></noscript>                        </a>         \n        </div>\n        \n\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\n\t\t<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Steam cleaner and all you need to know</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"entry-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/steam-cleaner/\" rel=\"bookmark\">Steam cleaner and all you need to know</a>\n\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t<h5 class=\"entry-date\"><i class=\"fa fa-calendar-o\"></i> <a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/steam-cleaner/\" title=\"9:04 am\" rel=\"bookmark\"><time class=\"entry-date\" datetime=\"2017-04-06T09:04:33+00:00\" pubdate=\"\">6th April 2017 </time></a><span class=\"byline\"><span class=\"sep\"></span><i class=\"fa fa-user\"></i>\n<span class=\"author vcard\"><a class=\"url fn n\" href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/author/administrator/\" title=\"View all posts by David\" rel=\"author\">David</a></span></span></h5>\n\t\t</div><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t\t\t</header><!-- .entry-header -->\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\t\t\t\t<p><a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/steam-cleaner/handheld-steam-cleaner/\"><img src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/handheld-steam-cleaner-300x288.png\" class=\"alignright wp-image-41\" alt=\"\" width=\"213\" height=\"204\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/handheld-steam-cleaner-300x288.png 300w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/handheld-steam-cleaner-281x270.png 281w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/handheld-steam-cleaner.png 433w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 213px) 100vw, 213px\"><noscript><img class=\"alignright wp-image-41\" src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/handheld-steam-cleaner-300x288.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"213\" height=\"204\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/handheld-steam-cleaner-300x288.png 300w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/handheld-steam-cleaner-281x270.png 281w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/handheld-steam-cleaner.png 433w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 213px) 100vw, 213px\" /></noscript></a>Steam cleaners use vapor steam that is dry to disinfect or sanitize, clean as well as remove buildups and stains. The machines are perfect for hard surfaces such as sealed floors and grout and tiles and ideal as well for cleaning spots of softer materials such as upholstery and carpets.</p>\n<p><em>The machines generate up to 360 F temperatures hence they kill mold, bacteria, fungus and any other allergen. The steam cleaners use a low-pressure of about 150 psi.</em></p>\n<p>Water is heated using a boiler in the steam cleaner which converts it to vapor which then exits through the nozzle out of the machine. The steam generated cleans by loosening the dirt on the soft fibers and hard surfaces which are then wiped out or taken as vacuum. Vapor contained in steam cleaners contain water 5% which is quite dry compared to the air we take in. some steam cleaners use detergents and cleaning solutions with others including vacuums.</p>\n<h2>Components of a steam cleaner.</h2>\n<p><strong>Boiler.</strong><br>\n<img src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steam-vaccum-cleaners-in-action-300x230.png\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-42\" alt=\"steam vacuum cleaners in action\" width=\"300\" height=\"230\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steam-vaccum-cleaners-in-action-300x230.png 300w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steam-vaccum-cleaners-in-action-352x270.png 352w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steam-vaccum-cleaners-in-action.png 483w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"><noscript><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-42\" src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steam-vaccum-cleaners-in-action-300x230.png\" alt=\"steam vacuum cleaners in action\" width=\"300\" height=\"230\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steam-vaccum-cleaners-in-action-300x230.png 300w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steam-vaccum-cleaners-in-action-352x270.png 352w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steam-vaccum-cleaners-in-action.png 483w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></noscript>Boiler boils water turning it to steam. Boilers are subjected to very high pressures and heat hence their top grade versions are made using stainless steel. Boilers have heating elements that are replaceable to enable replacement of the single component instead of the whole boiler.</p>\n<p><strong>Refill tank.</strong><br>\nMost of&nbsp; the best steam cleaners contain refill tanks that are not pressurized to enable the person operating the cleaner to add water as the machine still runs. If the system lacks a refill tank, the operator then must depressurize it, then add water directly to the boiler and wait for a minimum of 20 minutes for heating of the water.</p>\n<p><strong>Detergent tanks.</strong><br>\nThese are the tanks that dispense and hold the detergents or cleaning solutions. Some steam cleaners come with handles to be used to control the steam and detergent flow during cleaning.</p>\n<p><strong>Steam vacuum.</strong><br>\nSteam cleaners also contain vacuums used to empty the contents of the cleaner automatically into tanks of extraction of about 35 liters. They boost productivity as they allow cleaning and extraction without using towels.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\n\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n</article><!-- #post-## -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<article id=\"post-37\" class=\"post-content post-37 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-appliances\">\n\n\t\n\t\n\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\n\t\t<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Video \u2013 How GPS Work These Days</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"entry-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/video-gps-work-days/\" rel=\"bookmark\">Video \u2013 How GPS Work These Days</a>\n\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t<h5 class=\"entry-date\"><i class=\"fa fa-calendar-o\"></i> <a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/video-gps-work-days/\" title=\"9:04 am\" rel=\"bookmark\"><time class=\"entry-date\" datetime=\"2017-04-05T09:04:15+00:00\" pubdate=\"\">5th April 2017 </time></a><span class=\"byline\"><span class=\"sep\"></span><i class=\"fa fa-user\"></i>\n<span class=\"author vcard\"><a class=\"url fn n\" href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/author/administrator/\" title=\"View all posts by David\" rel=\"author\">David</a></span></span></h5>\n\t\t</div><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t\t\t</header><!-- .entry-header -->\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>The GPS (Global Positioning System), present in many land, air, and marine vehicles but also in a majority of smartphones, is now part of our daily life.</p>\n<p>Since 1978, the US Army maintains a fleet of satellites whose function is to continuously send a radio signal containing information, namely the position of the transmitting instrument and the time of sending the signal.</p>\n<p>On the ground, GPS geolocation devices such as are found in automobiles or smartphones have antennas that pick up these signals. A GPS receiver notes the time at which it receives a given signal, the time at which the signal was transmitted and understands the time taken to complete the route. Since radio waves propagate at the speed of light, we can assume the distance from the satellite.</p>\n<p>The GPS system comprises at least 24 satellites operating in the Earth\u2019s orbit at an altitude of approximately 20,000 km. They work by triangulation and make it easy to determine a location.</p>\n<p>These satellites carry extremely precise atomic clocks which give the geolocation an accuracy of about 30 meters. The clocks of the European Galileo system which will soon be put into service are three times more precise. The geolocation then approaches in the accuracy of the meter.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IoRQiNFzT0k\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\n\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n</article><!-- #post-## -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<article id=\"post-33\" class=\"post-content post-33 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-appliances\">\n\n\t\n\t        <div class=\"featured-image\">\n        \t        \t<a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/how-microwaves-work/\" rel=\"bookmark\">\n            <img src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mum-cooking-using-a-microwave-oven.png\" width=\"565\" height=\"311\" class=\"attachment-nisarg-full-width size-nisarg-full-width wp-post-image\" alt=\"mum cooking using a microwave oven\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mum-cooking-using-a-microwave-oven.png 565w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mum-cooking-using-a-microwave-oven-300x165.png 300w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mum-cooking-using-a-microwave-oven-491x270.png 491w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px\"><noscript><img width=\"565\" height=\"311\" src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mum-cooking-using-a-microwave-oven.png\" class=\"attachment-nisarg-full-width size-nisarg-full-width wp-post-image\" alt=\"mum cooking using a microwave oven\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mum-cooking-using-a-microwave-oven.png 565w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mum-cooking-using-a-microwave-oven-300x165.png 300w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mum-cooking-using-a-microwave-oven-491x270.png 491w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px\" /></noscript>                        </a>         \n        </div>\n        \n\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\n\t\t<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Get a better understanding of how a microwave works !</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"entry-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/how-microwaves-work/\" rel=\"bookmark\">Get a better understanding of how a microwave works !</a>\n\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t<h5 class=\"entry-date\"><i class=\"fa fa-calendar-o\"></i> <a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/how-microwaves-work/\" title=\"3:20 am\" rel=\"bookmark\"><time class=\"entry-date\" datetime=\"2017-04-02T03:20:00+00:00\" pubdate=\"\">2nd April 2017 </time></a><span class=\"byline\"><span class=\"sep\"></span><i class=\"fa fa-user\"></i>\n<span class=\"author vcard\"><a class=\"url fn n\" href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/author/administrator/\" title=\"View all posts by David\" rel=\"author\">David</a></span></span></h5>\n\t\t</div><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t\t\t</header><!-- .entry-header -->\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>Microwave ovens are one of the most convenient ways of cooking food because they heat food up very quickly.</p>\n<p>Most people have probably used a microwave at some point during their lives, but they may not realise exactly how it works.

Microwaves are the shortest type of radio wave.</p>\n<p>They are electromagnetic waves that measure about 12cm in length. They are produced in the oven by a magnetron. When these microwaves are directed towards the good, they cause the particles within the food to become agitated.</p>\n<p>As these particles move around, they begin to generate heat, and this is how the food becomes cooked. Most microwaves also have a setting where you can defrost food and this works on the same principle.</p>\n<h3>Is Using A Microwave Oven Safe?</h3>\n<p>The microwaves that are used to heat the food cannot escape from the oven. It is because metal surrounds the compartment where the food is cooked.</p>\n<p>The glass doors of the oven also prevent the microwaves from escaping. Microwaves cannot pass through the materials that the oven is made from, meaning that they are only directed towards the food.</p>\n<h4>Are Microwave Ovens Efficient?</h4>\n<p>Using a microwave is more efficient than using a conventional oven, but they are not as effective overall as you may expect. A lot of energy is needed to produce the microwaves that cook the food, and some heat is always lost.</p>\n<p>While the majority of the microwaves will be directed towards the food, there is no feature that allows them all to be concentrated on a particular spot and so the space around the food will also become heated in the same way as in a conventional oven, but to a lesser degree.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\n\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n</article><!-- #post-## -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<article id=\"post-29\" class=\"post-content post-29 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-appliances\">\n\n\t\n\t        <div class=\"featured-image\">\n        \t        \t<a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/3d-printers-modern-era/\" rel=\"bookmark\">\n            <img src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/printing-new-type-of-products.png\" width=\"524\" height=\"291\" class=\"attachment-nisarg-full-width size-nisarg-full-width wp-post-image\" alt=\"printing new type of products\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/printing-new-type-of-products.png 524w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/printing-new-type-of-products-300x167.png 300w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/printing-new-type-of-products-486x270.png 486w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px\"><noscript><img width=\"524\" height=\"291\" src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/printing-new-type-of-products.png\" class=\"attachment-nisarg-full-width size-nisarg-full-width wp-post-image\" alt=\"printing new type of products\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/printing-new-type-of-products.png 524w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/printing-new-type-of-products-300x167.png 300w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/printing-new-type-of-products-486x270.png 486w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px\" /></noscript>                        </a>         \n        </div>\n        \n\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\n\t\t<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">3D printers in the modern era</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"entry-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/3d-printers-modern-era/\" rel=\"bookmark\">3D printers in the modern era</a>\n\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t<h5 class=\"entry-date\"><i class=\"fa fa-calendar-o\"></i> <a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/3d-printers-modern-era/\" title=\"3:15 am\" rel=\"bookmark\"><time class=\"entry-date\" datetime=\"2017-03-30T03:15:38+00:00\" pubdate=\"\">30th March 2017 </time></a><span class=\"byline\"><span class=\"sep\"></span><i class=\"fa fa-user\"></i>\n<span class=\"author vcard\"><a class=\"url fn n\" href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/author/administrator/\" title=\"View all posts by David\" rel=\"author\">David</a></span></span></h5>\n\t\t</div><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t\t\t</header><!-- .entry-header -->\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>3D printing which can also be referred to as additive manufacturing is a process that involves using a digital file to make objects with three dimensions.

The case is also true while using 3D printers. An example of a virtual design can be Computer Aided Design also known as CAD, which has its creation from using a scanner or an application used for modelling.</p>\n<h3>What are some of the technologies that 3D scanners use?</h3>\n<p>With the growth in technology, it is no surprise that various types of technologies have been used in the making of 3D scanners. Some of these technologies include volumetric scanning and time of flight amongst many others. In the recent time, giants like Google and<br>\nMicrosoft has chipped in by enabling some of their devices to undertake 3D scanning processes.<br>\nAn example of this is the Microsoft\u2019s kinetics. With the direction through which technology is taking the world, it will not take a long time before people can be able to digitise real objects into 3D models in an easier way. Perhaps easier like taking a picture of the object.</p>\n<h4>What about softwares?</h4>\n<p>Just as the technologies used in creating them, the software that is used to create 3D scanners come in many forms. The software ranges from price to price. Some can cost you a lot of money regarding the expenses of licensing per year while others can be cheaper or available free such as Blender.</p>\n<p>The type of software you use for your printer will depend on your level and knowledge of operating them. For example, if you are a beginner, you will use a different software as compared to one that a professional will use.</p>\n<h5>How do you get started with this technology?</h5>\n<p>It may involve you starting by asking yourself where you want to start learning. You must decide whether you only want to focus on the hardware bit of the printer or you want to create objects.</p>\n<p>This will again depend on the amount of money that you have for spending in learning how to work with 3D printers. If you have a tight budget, you can choose to acquire cheap 3D printers and start from there.</p>\n<p>Various 3D printers use various types of technologies and software. In addition to that, you can use different methods of printing. A good example is using an additive. The type of method you use will determine the creation of the final object.</p>\n<p>Overall, you can start learning how 3D printers work better by acquiring one. You do not have to break the bank to achieve this, as there are some cheap printers for beginners in the market today.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZB624C2Wfa4\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\n\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n</article><!-- #post-## -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<article id=\"post-15\" class=\"post-content post-15 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-appliances\">\n\n\t\n\t        <div class=\"featured-image\">\n        \t        \t<a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/how-electric-shavers-work/\" rel=\"bookmark\">\n            <img src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/man-shaving-in-the-morning.png\" width=\"641\" height=\"421\" class=\"attachment-nisarg-full-width size-nisarg-full-width wp-post-image\" alt=\"man shaving in the morning\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/man-shaving-in-the-morning.png 641w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/man-shaving-in-the-morning-300x197.png 300w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/man-shaving-in-the-morning-411x270.png 411w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px\"><noscript><img width=\"641\" height=\"421\" src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/man-shaving-in-the-morning.png\" class=\"attachment-nisarg-full-width size-nisarg-full-width wp-post-image\" alt=\"man shaving in the morning\" srcset=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/man-shaving-in-the-morning.png 641w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/man-shaving-in-the-morning-300x197.png 300w, http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/man-shaving-in-the-morning-411x270.png 411w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px\" /></noscript>                        </a>         \n        </div>\n        \n\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\n\t\t<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">How electric shavers work</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"entry-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/how-electric-shavers-work/\" rel=\"bookmark\">How electric shavers work</a>\n\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t<h5 class=\"entry-date\"><i class=\"fa fa-calendar-o\"></i> <a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/how-electric-shavers-work/\" title=\"8:46 am\" rel=\"bookmark\"><time class=\"entry-date\" datetime=\"2017-03-28T08:46:28+00:00\" pubdate=\"\">28th March 2017 </time></a><span class=\"byline\"><span class=\"sep\"></span><i class=\"fa fa-user\"></i>\n<span class=\"author vcard\"><a class=\"url fn n\" href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/author/administrator/\" title=\"View all posts by David\" rel=\"author\">David</a></span></span></h5>\n\t\t</div><!-- .entry-meta -->\n\t\t\t</header><!-- .entry-header -->\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>Electric shavers work entirely differently from blade razors as their cutting action is scissor-like, unlike the blade action which is direct skin contact.</p>\n<p>The hairs get into the razor screen which is perforated then the moving blades which are inside the electric razor at that point sever them.

The razors can be fueled by a battery powered or corded source of energy. Modern electric shavers mostly use rechargeable batteries.</p>\n<p>These components are electrical and very safe to use with water during cleaning and also they are water resistant. Most of the electric shavers do not require water or cream lubrication. Electric shavers are two types:</p>\n<h2>1.) Foil shavers.</h2>\n<p>Foil shavers work in such a way of moving the razor forth and back under the screen or foil. The shaver screen is perforated to allow hair to fall out through the perforations. Foil shavers contain at least four blade rows arranged in a line.</p>\n<p>As the blade moves forth and back, it cuts any hair that gets into the foil perforations. Various foil shavers have varied numbers of foils. The many foils lie on each other to cover the blades. Foil shavers are named as per the number of foil layers they have. Foil shaver containing three foil layers are called triple foils.</p>\n<h3>2.) Rotary shavers.</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rotative-blades-in-action.png\" class=\"alignright  wp-image-21\" alt=\"rotative blades in action\" width=\"159\" height=\"156\"><noscript><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-21\" src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rotative-blades-in-action.png\" alt=\"rotative blades in action\" width=\"159\" height=\"156\" /></noscript>Rotary has foils round and are held by springs in place. The springs act as the foils pivot to allow confirmation to the person being shaved face curves.</p>\n<p>Beneath the foils are wheels fitted with blades on them. The wheels spin round and cut any hair that gets into the perforations of the foil. The cut hair then falls into the razor\u2019s hollow parts leaving the skin free from irritation resulting from direct skin blades.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\n\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n</article><!-- #post-## -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</main><!-- #main -->\n\t\t\t</div><!-- #primary -->\n\t\t\t<div id=\"secondary\" class=\"col-md-3 sidebar widget-area\" role=\"complementary\">\n\t\t<aside id=\"search-2\" class=\"widget widget_search\">\n<form role=\"search\" method=\"get\" class=\"search-form\" action=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/\">\n\t<label>\n\t\t<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Search for:</span>\n\t\t<input type=\"search\" class=\"search-field\" placeholder=\"Search \u2026\" value=\"\" name=\"s\" title=\"Search for:\">\n\t</label>\n\t<button type=\"submit\" class=\"search-submit\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Search</span></button>\n</form>\n</aside>\t\t<aside id=\"recent-posts-2\" class=\"widget widget_recent_entries\">\t\t<h4 class=\"widget-title\">Recent Posts</h4>\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/what-if-windows-7-becomes-a-free-software/\">What if Windows 7 becomes a free software?</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/new-features-at-ifa-2019-berlins-major-high-tech-trade-fair/\">New features at IFA 2019, Berlin\u2019s major high-tech trade fair</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wifi-how-to-secure-your-home-network/\">WiFi: how to secure your home network</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/basics-foldable-smartphone-tech-explained/\">The Basics Of Foldable Smartphone Tech Explained</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/what-is-a-nas-server/\">What is a NAS and why you need one</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</aside><aside id=\"text-2\" class=\"widget widget_text\"><h4 class=\"widget-title\">Get cheap appliances online !</h4>\t\t\t<div class=\"textwidget\"><a href=\"https://www.appliancesconnection.com\">\n<img border=\"0\" alt=\"get your appliances online\" src=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/appliances-connection-banner.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"600\"></a></div><a href=\"https://www.appliancesconnection.com\">\n\t\t</a></aside><aside id=\"acx-social-icons-widget-2\" class=\"widget acx-fsmi-social-icons-desc\"><h4 class=\"widget-title\"><a href=\"https://www.appliancesconnection.com\">Social Media Icons</a></h4><style>\n.widget-acx-social-icons-widget-2-widget img \n{\nwidth:32px;
