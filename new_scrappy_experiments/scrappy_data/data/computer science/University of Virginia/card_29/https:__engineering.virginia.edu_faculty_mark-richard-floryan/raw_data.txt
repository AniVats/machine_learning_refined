I teach core computer science courses (e.g., Data Structures, Algorithms) as well as electives related to my field (e.g., Game Design, Artificial Intelligence, HCI). As a researcher, I strive to get undergraduate students involved in research activities and to continue to investigate the ways in which games, artificial intelligence, and human centered design can create more personalized educational experiences for all.\n</article>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"columns large-6\">\n<div class=\"faculty-info-section\">\n<div class=\"user-markup heading\">\n<span class=\"flag\"><svg class=\"icon icon-ribbon\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-ribbon\"></use></svg></span>"]}
