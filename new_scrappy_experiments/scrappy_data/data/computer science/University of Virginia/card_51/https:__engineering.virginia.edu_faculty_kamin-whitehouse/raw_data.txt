His team develops techniques at the intersection of signal processing, control theory, and machine learning. The technologies created by these projects have been downloaded 50,000+ times, have been used by over half a dozen companies to create new products, and are currently running in millions of embedded devices around the world. He has patents granted and pending in a range of CPS techniques. Prof. Whitehouse is serving as Director of the Link Lab, whose mission is to enhance excellence in CPS at the University of Virginia. He is a past TPC chair for ACM BuildSys, ACM SenSys, ACM/IEEE IPSN, and EWSN and serves as associate editor of ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks (TOSN) and The P of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies (IMWUT). He earned a B.A. in Philosophy and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Cognitive Science from Rutgers University. He earned M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from UC Berkeley.\n</article>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"columns large-6\">\n<div class=\"faculty-info-section\">\n<div class=\"user-markup heading\">\n<span class=\"flag\"><svg class=\"icon icon-ribbon\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-ribbon\"></use></svg></span>"]}
