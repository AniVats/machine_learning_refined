technologies at the frontier of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), including RF sensing, safety-critical wireless communication, wearable sensors, occupancy sensing, smart buildings, and coordinated control of distributed systems and autonomous drones. His team develops techniques at the intersection of signal processing, control theory, and machine learning. The technologies created by these projects have been downloaded 50,000+ times, have been used by over half a dozen companies to create new products, and are currently running in millions of embedded devices around the world. He has patents granted and pending in a range of CPS techniques. Prof. Whitehouse is Director of the Link Lab, which he co-founded in 2015, whose mission is to enhance excellence in CPS at U. Virginia. He is a past TPC chair for ACM BuildSys, ACM SenSys, ACM/IEEE IPSN, and EWSN and serves as associate editor of ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks (TOSN) and The PACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies (IMWUT). He earned a B.A. in Philosophy and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Cognitive Science from Rutgers University.
