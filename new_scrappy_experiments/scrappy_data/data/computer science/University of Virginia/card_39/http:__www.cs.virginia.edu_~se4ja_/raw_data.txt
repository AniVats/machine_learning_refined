My teaching centers on instilling cost-effective software development principles.    I am always recruiting strong students interested in  researching the intersection of software engineering, robotics, and machine learning. Please check the materials in this site, read a couple of the papers, etc. and then send me an email explaining the ideas that you have and why you want to work with me. \n\n\n\n    ", "\n          More  \n      \n        Posts\n        \n\n", "\n          More Publications by\n      \n        DBLP\n        \n  and\n      \n              Google Scholar \n       \n", "\nThis course will explore  state-of-the-art automated techniques that make the analysis of various software artifacts, from models to code, cost-effective. Topics include dynamic and static program analysis techniques, test generation, fault localization and debugging, model inferencing, and model checking. The course includes the utilization of the latest research tools and the development of a class project that builds and improves on existing techniques.\n\n"]}
