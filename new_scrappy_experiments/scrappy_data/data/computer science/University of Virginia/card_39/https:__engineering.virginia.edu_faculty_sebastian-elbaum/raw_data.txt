My teaching focuses on instilling cost-effective software development principles.\nI am the recipient of an NSF Career Award, an IBM Innovation Award, a Google Faculty Research Award, an FSE Test of Time Award, and 5 ACM SigSoft Distinguished Paper Awards (FSE2006, ICSE2008, ICSE2012, ISSTA2013, ICSE2016), mostly for empirically studying program analysis and software testing challenges, and developing automated techniques for addressing them. My current development and analysis work is focused on robotic systems.\nI served as Program Co-Chair of the 2015 International Conference on Software Engineering, Program Chair for the 2007 International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis, Program Co-Chair for the 2008 Empirical Software Engineering Symposium, Co-Editor for the Information and Software Technology Journal, and as Associate Editor of the ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodologies Journal. I am the Steering Committee Chair for ICSE. I was recognized as a Distinguished Scientist by the Association for Computing Machinery for my contributions to computing.\nI received my Ph.D. from the University of Idaho, and a Systems Engineering degree from Universidad Catolica de Cordoba, Argentina. I spent a significant part of my academic career at the University of Nebraska, where I co-founded two international recognized labs, the E2 Software Engineering Lab and the Nimbus Robotics Lab. I have spent my sabbaticals as a research scientist or research fellow at Google (Mountain View, USA), CNR (Pisa, Italy), and UCL (London, UK).\nFor more detailed and current information please visit my <a href=\"http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~se4ja/\">website</a>\n</article>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"columns large-6\">\n<div class=\"faculty-info-section\">\n<div class=\"user-markup heading\">\n<span class=\"flag\"><svg class=\"icon icon-ribbon\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-ribbon\"></use></svg></span>"]}
