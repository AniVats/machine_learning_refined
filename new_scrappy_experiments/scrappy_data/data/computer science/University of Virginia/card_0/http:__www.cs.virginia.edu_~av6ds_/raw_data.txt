My research explores novel and cross-disciplinary hardware and software techniques to design machines that offer greater levels of performance, energy efficiency, and security, while maintaining high programmability.  I'm also interested in applying novel machine learning techniques to detect and mitigate security threats, model dynamic execution behavior, and provide efficient hardware/runtime support to enable the seamless adoption of highly heterogeneous platforms and emerging computing paradigms.\n"]}
