He has worked in areas including software evolvability (including notions of the options value of modularity in design and how to reconcile the modularity-breaking potential of aspect-oriented programming with the need for abstraction and information hiding modularity to preserve evolvability properties); in value-based software engineering (seeking to better understand how to link software design to broader economic objectives, rather than from merely technical notions of design excellence), and on formal methods for software and systems assurance (including modest recently his work with John Knight and Jian Xiang on rela-world types and interpreted formalisms).\nOne of Kevin's current areas of work is in the establishment of a discipline of cyber-social learning systems, drawing together knowledge from a diversity of areas to inform the design of 21st century service systems: in healthcare, education, defense, and many other sectors of society.\n</article>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"column large-12\">\n<div class=\"faculty-info-section\">\n<div class=\"user-markup heading\">\n<span class=\"flag\"><svg class=\"icon icon-research\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-research\"></use></svg></span>\n<h2>Research Interests</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"items\">\n\n<span class=\"item-title\">Human Factors</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"item-title\">Cybersecurity</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"item-title\">Human Machine Interface</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"item-title\">Software Engineering</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"item-title\">Programming Languages and Compilers</span>\n\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"faculty-info-section\">\n<div class=\"user-markup heading\">\n<span class=\"flag\"><svg class=\"icon icon-publications\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-publications\"></use></svg></span>"]}
