I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Purdue University. My research interests include software systems security (i.e., securing software to prevent cyberattacks), cyber forensics (i.e., recovering cyber forensic evidence from data/programs), and software engineering (software testing and reverse-engineering). \n                            My research aims to build systems that automatically analyze, understand, and enhance software systems.\n                          \n                            I am actively looking for students who are interested in systems security research and/or building systems (Multiple positions, e.g., 3 or more, are available)UVa Today covered my research group and projects! research Subpage  research Content ) of sophisticated malware on various architectures (e.g., x86, ARM, MIPS) with little to no knowledge of the malware.
