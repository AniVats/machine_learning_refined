Dwyer is a John C. Knight Faculty Fellow and Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia.\u00a0 His research interests focus on methods for reasoning about the behavior of software.\u00a0 His prior work has improved and applied a wide-range of formal reasoning frameworks, such as model checking, symbolic execution, and abstract interpretation, to programs.\u00a0 His current efforts are exploring methods to assure the dependability of autonomous systems built from diverse component sources (e.g., software built by humans, trained by machine-learning approaches, or synthesized from high-level models).\n</article>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"columns large-6\">\n<div class=\"faculty-info-section\">\n<div class=\"user-markup heading\">\n<span class=\"flag\"><svg class=\"icon icon-ribbon\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-ribbon\"></use></svg></span>"]}
