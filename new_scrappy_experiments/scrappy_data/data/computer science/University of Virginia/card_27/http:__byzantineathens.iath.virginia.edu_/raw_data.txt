{"email": [], "image": ["byzathens_top.jpg"], "research_blurb": ["Building upon the Athenian Agora Excavations' digital initiatives, this project will employ computational methods to identify and systematically extract information from the excavation archives pertaining exclusively to the Byzantine and Frankish periods. Such methods will also allow the project to inter-relate different types of information (artifacts, maps, notes) and integrate different media (text, images, 3D reconstructions, video etc.) that will in turn\u00a0 \u00a0support a detailed study, visualization and interpretation of the excavation results. \u00a0Existing paper site maps, floor plans and drawings of Byzantine buildings will be updated and re-created in 2D and 3D environments to clearly display changes in spatial organization, use of space and architecture, and contribute to the reconstructing of the Byzantine settlement in the area of the Agora which is now destroyed and completely lost. The project will eventually provide access to its research results and tools on the web to enhance communication, collaboration and dissemination of knowledge across different audiences while remaining respectful to ASCSA's terms and conditions regarding their archives' use and publication.The digital tools designed in collaboration with the specialist at IATH will provide new and effective ways to analyze and synthesize large and heterogeneous datasets that form the basis of the project's study on the relation between human behavior, spaces and objects in Byzantine cities. We also hope that the project can provide new solutions in dealing with legacy data that can be replicated and used by other archaeological projects that face similar challenges in making their archival collections more usable and accessible. Finally the tools developed during the fellowship will provide the foundation for future research on creating content for portable devices and apps that will allow visitors at the archaeological site to engage with the Athenian Agora's diachronic history and monuments in interesting and engaging ways."]}
