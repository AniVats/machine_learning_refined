{"email": [], "image": [], "research_blurb": ["Welcome to the home page of the Arapesh Grammar and Digital Language Archive. The archive was conceived as a way of preserving, integrating, and disseminating some of the rich documentary material that has been produced on the Arapesh languages - Arapesh, Alpe\u0283, Ar\u0259pec, Bukiyip, W\u0259ri, Ilahita, Abu\u0294, Muhia\u014b, \"Ap\u0259ki\u0272 Bora\u0272\" or \"our talk\" - languages traditionally spoken by some twenty five thousand villagers living on the coast and in the Torricelli hills of East Sepik Province, Papua New Guinea. Arapesh is of special linguistic interest because of its typologically unusual system of grammatical categorization that makes systematic reference to a noun\u2019s sound, as opposed to its meaning, in order to determine its class and hence what plural marker and agreement forms it will take."]}
