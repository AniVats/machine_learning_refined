Traditionally spoken by people living along the New Guinea north coast, in many villages Arapesh is no longer being learned by children, who grow up speaking the local lingua franca Tok Pisin instead. In addition to ensuring that Arapesh is preserved in a robust form for future generations, the Digital Language Archive will serve as a research tool for the other part of Dobrin's project, producing a written grammar of Arapesh focusing on the Cemaun dialect. A multilingual, multimedia web site will also be developed to provide the public with an accessible resource on this remarkable group of languages. Promotes on-line collaborative research on nineteenth and twentieth century English-language collections of biographies of women, and will expand on Collective Biographies of Women: An Annotated Bibliography, a web site that examines more than 930 collections of women's biographies published between 1830-1940 in Britain and North America. These books, written by both men and women, cover a surprising range of subjects\u2014historical and literary, biblical and legendary, martyrs and murderers, queens and reformers\u2014and have much in common with the genres of popular fiction, self-help, and history. Mapping the Dalai Lamas intends to integrate digital texts of classical Tibetan-language biographies with digital animated maps, timelines, and images to present significant events in the lives of the Dalai Lamas as well as to reveal hitherto unnoticed connections between biographical events, geographic location, social and historical context, and literary and rhetorical expression.The Dresser Trunk Project documents eleven venues and cities along the Southern Crescent Line, currently run by Amtrak.  The Southern Crescent runs from New York to New Orleans. These venues were places of refuge for black travelers during segregation.  The research documents the hotels, nightclubs, and other destinations that were safe havens for black travelers during segregation.  Many of the venues along the Crescent route no longer exist, while others are in various stages of neglect.The purpose of this project is to identify locations around the country, establish links between the different locations i.e. who traveled between where and when.  Preserve images, stories and documents that tell the story of each location.  Culminating in the creation of a clearinghouse of information for significant venues in the black business districts and communities.  Scholars, music historians, preservationist, and community leaders will use the collection of these national treasures. Rome Reborn 1.0 is the continuation of five centuries of research by scholars, architects and artists since the Renaissance who have attempted to restore the ruins of the ancient city with words, maps and images. \"Rome Reborn 1.0\" is a true 3D model that runs in real time. Users can navigate through the model with complete freedom, moving up, down, left and right at will. They can enter important public buildings such as the Roman Senate House, the Colosseum, or the Temple of Venus and Rome, the ancient city's largest place of worship.The World of Dante offers a hypermedia environment for the study of the Inferno. This project is designed to appeal to the different purposes of a wide range of readers, not simply those with scholarly interests. This version of the Inferno is generated by software from a densely encoded electronic text. Unlike other versions of the poem presently online, this copy of the Inferno has been tagged using SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language).This project will explore the extent to which later medieval ecclesiastical architecture in England is determined by the fact that it is typically an addition to a pre-existing physical structure and how it is a response to cultural issues such as program, patronage and external stylistic influences.  Multi-dimensional dynamic digital models will be developed for this investigation, which will be available on the web for those with an interest in the specific case studies as well as scholars concerned with developing new methodologies for research in architectural history.The \"Lives of the  Saints\" Project will focus on those Lives that were written in French  (including Anglo-Norman but not Occitan), in verse or prose or both between  c. 880 and 1504 of the Christian era. These texts (also known collectively  as hagiography) were arguably the most widely enjoyed literary and religious works of the Middle Ages. Today, however, most of them languish in manuscript  vaults and in faulty, rare, century-old editions; very few have been  translated into modern French or English. One main goal of this project  is to demonstrate both the central role of hagiography in medieval French  culture and the inherent appeal of the works in order to stimulate further  research, especially the preparation of editions and translations that will make the Lives accessible to all readers.This project focuses on the Lien\u00fc zhuan (Traditions of Exemplary Women) of Liu  Xiang (77-6 B.C.), the earliest extant book in the Chinese tradition solely  devoted to the moral education of women. The book consists of biographical accounts of female role models in early China and became the standard textbook  for women's education for the next two millennia. The Lien\u00fc zhuan offers  important insights into the culture, politics, and social structure of  early China, as well as into the representation of women in various phases  of China's history. This project includes a translation of the text, a  book-length study, and a digital archive that will serve as a publicly accessible tool for scholarly exploration (in both English and Chinese)  of women's social, legal, and ritual status as represented in the texts  of specific periods in Chinese history.The Thomas MacGreevy Archive is a long-term, interdisciplinary  research project committed to exploring the intersections between traditional  humanities research and digital technologies. To date, the Archive has focused on publishing an on-line bibliography  of writings by and about Thomas MacGreevy. Over 300 texts, augmented with enhanced search and navigation features, have been encoded in Standard Generalised Markup language (SGML).The project is founded on three premises. First as the best-selling novel and most frequently dramatized story in the 19th Century America, Uncle Tom's Cabin can teach us an enormous amount about our history and culture. No text has more to say about how American society has understood relations between the races, the meaning of slavery, the nature and place of women and men, the significance of Christians, the South as a region, and so on. Second, access to original texts and manuscripts of Stowe's work will enrich the learning experience and further an understanding of society during the 19th century.  Third, modern electronic technology can give us powerful new ways to research and appreciate our past.Subtitled \"New Technologies and Sociologies of Research,\" the project seeks to extend both the terms and forms of the study of London, the dominant metropolis of the nineteenth century, a center of social and cultural meanings, and a resonant locus for interdisciplinary exchange. The large scale of the research endeavor will lead to the construction of an archive of primary materials-journalism, literary works, paintings, census data, maps, tracts, cartoons, sermons-open to scholars and teachers in a wide range of disciplines, and at the same time it will be the occasion for ongoing electronic publication, essays and books linked to the repository of artifacts. From the beginning of 1999 both the archive and the scholarship will appear on the internet under the sponsorship of Cambridge University Press.The Walt Whitman Archive is an electronic research and teaching tool that sets out to make Whitman's vast work, for the first time, easily and conveniently accessible to scholars, students, and general readers. Whitman, America's most influential poet and one of the four or five most innovative and significant writers in United States history, is the most challenging of all American authors in terms of the textual difficulties his work presentsThe Mayan Epigraphic Database Project (MED) is an experiment in networked scholarship with the purpose of enhancing Classic Mayan epigraphic research. At present, MED consists of a relational database of glyphs (\"gnumbers\"), images, phonetic values (\"pvalues\"), and semantic values (\"svalues\") according to the consensus among various American Mayanists (MacLeod and Reents-Budet 1994). Also present is the beginning of an archive of digitally transcribed Mayan texts. The Pompeii Forum Project is a collaborative research venture that is archaeologicaly based, heavily dependent upon advanced technology, and so conceived as to address broad issues in urban history and urban design. Evidence gathered to date challenges commonly held and widely published notions about the evolution of the forum, especially during the final years of the city's life. The goals are to provide the first systematic documentation of the architecture and decoration of the forum, to interpret evidence as it pertains to Pompeii's urban history, and to make wider contributions to both the history of urbanism and contemporary problems of urban design."]}
