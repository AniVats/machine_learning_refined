He has a secondary appointment in Engineering Systems and Environment at UVA. He is also the Co-Founder of Expresso Logic, a NSF SBIR small business delivering machine learning solutions to control engineering problems. He received his Ph.D. (2015) and M.S. (2012), in Electrical and Systems Engineering, both from the University of Pennsylvania. He has held visiting researcher positions at Honeywell Automation and Control Laboratory, and at ETH Zurich, Switzerland.\nHis research interests lie in cyber physical systems, machine learning, control systems, statistics, and optimization. His work on Data Predictive Control (DPC) aims at bridging the gap between machine learning and control synthesis. Applications of his work include energy-efficient buildings, smart cities, industrial automation, advanced manufacturing, autonomous vehicles, internet of things, and medical devices.\nDr. Behl is the winner of the Department of Energy\u2019s EERE 2016 Cleantech University Prize (regional). His research has won the TECHCON Best Paper Award (2015), and the best demo award at BuildSys, 2012. In 2011, he won the World Embedded Software Contest held in Seoul by the Korean Ministry of Knowledge Economy. He is also the recipient of the 2011 Richard K. Dentel Memorial Prize awarded for research in urban transportation. Dr. Behl also serves as an invited member on the Future Directions subcommittee of the IEEE Power and Energy Society.\n</article>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"columns large-6\">\n<div class=\"faculty-info-section\">\n<div class=\"user-markup heading\">\n<span class=\"flag\"><svg class=\"icon icon-ribbon\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-ribbon\"></use></svg></span>"]}
