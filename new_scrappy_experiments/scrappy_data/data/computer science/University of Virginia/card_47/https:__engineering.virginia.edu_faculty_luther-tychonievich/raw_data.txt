I wrote my first program and declared my CS major between my second and third year of college; I fell in love with its versatility, scope, and power; it is a field that combines the human-defined purity and elegance of mathematics with the real-world impact of engineering. During my graduate work I became fascinated with\u00a0the issues relating to education of a new generation of computer scientists and how to help people from backgrounds that are traditionally-underrepresented in CS recognize the marvelous opportunities the field offers and excel in the field. In addition to teaching, I\u00a0devote significant effort to the education of educators (primarily teaching assistants, but also high-school and college faculty) and to the design of data models that encourage correct mental models in humanities research as part of\u00a0<a href=\"http://fhiso.org/\">FHISO</a> and <a href=\"http://rootsdev.org/\">rootsdev</a>.\n</article>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"column large-12\">\n<div class=\"faculty-info-section\">\n<div class=\"user-markup heading\">\n<span class=\"flag\"><svg class=\"icon icon-ribbon\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-ribbon\"></use></svg></span>"]}
