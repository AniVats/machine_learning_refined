These components or nodes may be deployed in\nthousands to achieve a common\nmission. They may be used to monitor\npoorly accessible or dangerous environments such as the\nocean floor, neighborhoods of volcanic activities, hostile territories (e.g., behind enemy lines),\ndisaster areas, and nuclearly active fields. They may also be deployed to accomplish interactive\ntasks such as finding and detonating enemy mines, looking for survivors of natural disasters, or\ncontaining and isolating oil spills to protect a nearby coastline. These wireless sensor devices\nare also useful for environmental monitoring, medical applications and smart\nhomes, buildings, or cities. The new technology creates a\ndifferent set of challenges arising from the fact that: \n\n<menu>\n<img src=\"redbull.gif\"/>\n   Nodes are embedded into a geographic landscape and interact tightly with the physical\n   environment in real-time. \n<br/><img src=\"redbull.gif\"/>\n   Nodes are smaller and less reliable than traditional network routers. \n <br/><img src=\"redbull.gif\"/>\n   Nodes generate (and possibly store) data from sensors unlike traditional routers.\n <br/><img src=\"redbull.gif\"/>\n Nodes operate under severe constraints on power, computation, bandwidth and memory.\n <br/><img src=\"redbull.gif\"/>\n  Nodes may be mobile. \n <br/><img src=\"redbull.gif\"/>\n   Nodes may be subject to security attacks.\n <br/>\n</menu>\n Our past work included developing MAC and routing layer\nsolutions, group management protocols based on novel semantics,\nanalysis and implementation\ntechniques for achieving aggregate behavior, novel data services\nprotocols including sensor net querying capabilities, development of a\nsophisticated event service for WSNs, protocols for\npower management, protocols for computer security, and developing\nnew paradigms for sensor net programming. We worked with\na testbed of MICA and XSM motes.  We have built and evaluated a 203 \nnode system\nat Fort MacDill AFB and Avon Park called VigilNet. This system was used\nfor detection, tracking and classification with power management capabilities\nthat extends the lifetime of the system significantly. We also\nextended\nthe basic system and implemented\na novel tripwire power management system. We\npresented many demonstrations of the improved system.\nOur research partners included\nCMU and\nthe University of Illinois.\n\n\n In the past we also completed a testbed for\nan environmental science application called Luster\nthat mimics a system that requires both\nperiodic monitoring and event based actions. The system measured the affect\nof sunlight on under brush growth. On this project we collaborated with the\nEnvironmental Sciences department at UVA. The system was deployed\non the Eastern Shore of Virginia where various environmental\nstudies have been ongong since the early 1980s.\nSee also <a href=\"http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~yw5s/luster\">Luster</a> and\n<a href=\"http://seemote.openwsn.com/\">SeeMote</a><a>.\n\n\n</a><a> Our more recent work is in smart and connected health and smart cities areas.\nIn the smart health arena we built a testbed to \nemulate WSNs in assisted living facilities. This system is called \nAlarmNet and extended in a systems called Empath. We worked with the \nUVA medical school and Harvard.  \nSee also  </a><a href=\"http://www.cs.virginia.edu/wsn/medical/\">Wireless\nNetworking for Assisted Living and Other Medical Applications</a>.\nSee also <a href=\"http://www.openwsn.com/\">Hardware We Developed for Medical\nApplications</a>. We also have developed many solutions based on wearables.\n\n Various projects included: (i) a complete redesign of body \nsensor networks from silicon to the user (joint with the University of \nMichigan), (ii) a BSN for fall detetcion based on a context free grammar \nand area context sensors, (iii) a home health care system for early detection of\ndepression, (iv) the Musical Heart smartphone system for controlling heart rate\nwith music, (v) a general sound engine and app development \nenvironment (API) for smartphones, (vi) robust \nactivity recognition that accounts for overlapped\nactivities and missing sensor readings, (vii) runtime assurance techniques, \n(viii) use of multiple classifiers to detect faults and minimize the number\nof repair dispatches and nodes repaired, (ix) a system capable of inferring\nwater events in a home, (x) various medical applications using the Kinect \nsystem,\n(xi) classifiers for detetcing mood from voice at a distance, (xii) a medical\nreminder system using a smart watch, and (xiii) detecting eating events using a smart \nwatch in the wild.\nPapers below cover many aspects of these projects.\n\n All this material is based, in part,\n upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants No. \nCNS-0614870, CNS-0614773, CNS-0626616, and CNS-0626632.\n\n Any opinions, findings and conclusions or recomendations expressed \nin this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily \nreflect the views of the National Science Foundation (NSF).\n\n\n<br/>\u00a0\n<br/>\u00a0\n<img src=\"clr-line2.gif\"/>"]}
