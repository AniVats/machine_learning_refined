I also spent a year as visiting research fellow at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) n the Computer Vision group. My research lies at the intersection of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I am especially interested in analyzing, and mining useful human insights from enormous amounts of images with associated text. I am also interested in big scale visual analytics by learning models that can perform high-level perceptual tasks for applications in social media, urban computing, and everyday activities. I'm a recipient of the 2013\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.pamitc.org/iccv13/awards.php\">IEEE Marr Prize</a>\u00a0in Computer Vision, Best Long Paper Award at EMNLP 2017, and Faculty Awards from Google and IBM Research.\n</article>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"columns large-6\">\n<div class=\"faculty-info-section\">\n<div class=\"user-markup heading\">\n<span class=\"flag\"><svg class=\"icon icon-ribbon\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-ribbon\"></use></svg></span>"]}
