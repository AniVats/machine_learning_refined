My research focuses on how to design\nand build systems to ensure these devices are effective, unobtrusive, and\nscalable. I ground my projects in real applications, spanning from more\nefficient buildings to smarter cities to healthier individuals.\nMy work involves building real prototypes and demonstrating them at\nreasonable scale. This systems approach includes building the hardware itself,\ndesigning and deploying gateways that providing networking and services for the\nembedded devices, and supporting the deployments with a cloud infrastructure for\nprocessing and visualization.\n<strong>I\u2019m looking for motivated EE/CpE/CS Ph.D. students to join my lab.</strong> If you\nare interested in building sensors, networking devices, deploying systems, or\ndesigning better IoT systems, get in touch."]}
