I have been exposed to many new ideas and teaching strategies that I can use in my CS classes right away.\n\n<br> &nbsp; </li> <li>\nThis workshop is just what I needed. I have had severe burnout due to learning new materials to teach CS in the last two years. I now see light at the end of the tunnel and am excited to try all of the good ideas I received. I now know I am not alone!\n<br> &nbsp; \n        </li> <li>\nThis workshop allowed me to consider ideas I never thought about in my classroom that will translate easily and significantly to every single class I teach in the future. I am so thankful for this opportunity! The speakers were wonderfully informative and thoughtful and I consider myself very fortunate to be able to attend this workshop! Thank you!!!\n<br> &nbsp; \n            </li> <li>\n\nTapestry has completely changed my life and teaching. Without Tapestry, I would have left the teaching profession and gone back into law practice\n<br> &nbsp; \n\n                </li> <li>\nExcellent learning opportunity for my. All of the content was informative and engaging.\n<br> &nbsp; \n\n                    </li> <li>\nThis truly is the most meaningful workshop I have ever attended. Delving into the causes of stereotype threat and then learning practical activities and actions we can do to eliminate it was so valuable. I now have the resources I need to reach out and engage ALL students in CS!\n<br> &nbsp; \n                        </li> <li>\n\nAwesome!! Learned and got totally reinvigorated about teaching cs\n<br> &nbsp; \n                            </li> <li>\n\nEnergy of presenter and varied format helped me stay engaged\n<br> &nbsp; \n                                </li> \n                            </ul>\n<hr>\n\n<a id=\"pathfinders\">\n<h3> Pathfinders Summer Institute </h3>\n\n</a><ul><a id=\"pathfinders\"></a><li><a id=\"pathfinders\"> The </a><a href=\"http://www.infosys.org/infosys-foundation-usa/pathfinders/\">Institute</a> is one of many efforts of the \n    <a href=\"http://www.infosys.org/infosys-foundation-usa/\"> Infosys Foundations, USA</a> to inspire students and educators to become technology creators </li></ul>\n\n</blockquote>\n   <h3> &nbsp; </h3>\n   <h3> &nbsp; </h3>\n   <h3> &nbsp; </h3>\n   <h3> &nbsp; </h3>\n   <h3> &nbsp; </h3>\n   <h3> &nbsp; </h3>\n   <h3> &nbsp; </h3>\n   <h3> &nbsp; </h3>\n   <h3> &nbsp; </h3>\n   <h3> &nbsp; </h3>\n   <h3> &nbsp; </h3>\n   <h3> &nbsp; </h3>\n   <h3> &nbsp; </h3>\n   <h3> &nbsp; </h3>\n   <h3> &nbsp; </h3>\n   <h3> &nbsp; </h3>\n   <h3> &nbsp; </h3>\n    <!-- end #mainContent --> </div>\n\n<!-- end #container --></div>\n\n\n\n</body></html>"
