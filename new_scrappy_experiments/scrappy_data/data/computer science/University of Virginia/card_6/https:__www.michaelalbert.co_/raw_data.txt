First, the development of block chain based systems for distributed computation (e.g. Ethereum) will lead to an unprecedented ability to decentralize the allocation of resources. Second, the coming introduction of self-driving, connected vehicles will lead to a once in a generation opportunity to revamp traffic infrastructure. Third, the move to a \"smart\" grid for the distribution of electricity and intelligent appliances that can respond to pricing information will allow for a degree of sensitivity to incentives that, up to now, has been impossible in energy markets. I have been involved in research in each of these three areas. Please look at my <a href=\"research.html\">publications</a> for more information.\nLonger term, I am very interested in machine learning questions in settings where the agents generating the data have incentives to <i>strategically manipulate the data</i>. This line of research requires combining traditional algorithms in machine learning with techniques from <i>mechanism design</i> to provably generate accurate data.\n\t  \n<a class=\"btn btn-secondary custom_button_width\" href=\"research.html\" role=\"button\">View Publications \u00bb</a>\n\n<hr class=\"featurette-divider\"/>\n<div class=\"col-md-12 col-lg-4\">\n<a name=\"contact\"></a>"]}
