Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania. I hold a My research focuses on assuring the safety and trustworthiness of cyber-physical systems (CPS). I develop modeling and analysis methods for CPS, drawing on formal methods, machine learning, control theory, and human factors. I also work across many different application domains, from autonomous robots, to smart cities, to medical systems. For example, my research on the safety and trust of driverless cars is featured in I am looking to hire a postdoc researcher with expertise in Cyber-Physical Systems, Control, Machine Learning and/or Artificial Intelligence. I am looking for PhD students with interests and expertise in cyber-physical systems, robotics, formal methods, and machine learning."]}
