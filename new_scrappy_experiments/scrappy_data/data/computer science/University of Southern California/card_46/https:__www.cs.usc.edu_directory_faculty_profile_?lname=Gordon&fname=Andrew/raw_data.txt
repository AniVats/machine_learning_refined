Gordon is a Research Associate Professor of Computer Science and Director of Interactive Narrative Research at the Institute for Creative Technologies at the University of Southern California. His research advances technologies for automatically analyzing and generating narrative interpretations of experiences. A central aim of his research is the large-scale formalization of commonsense knowledge, and reasoning with these formalizations using logical abduction. He is the author of the 2004 book \"Strategy Representation: An Analysis of Planning Knowledge,\" and the 2017 book \"A Formal Theory of Commonsense Psychology: How People Think People Think\" (with Jerry R. Hobbs). He received his Ph.D. in 1999 from Northwestern University.<br/><br/><div class=\"research-piece\"><h4>Research Summary</h4><hr/>Andrew S. Gordon conducts research in artificial intelligence, aiming to design software systems capable of human-like commonsense reasoning abilities. All of his research efforts have involved narrative in some way - narrative interpretation, narrative generation, interactive narrative, cross-cultural narrative, narrative and the brain. His current efforts are focused on automated narrative interpretation of the famous \"Heider-Simmel Film,\" and on the creation of interactive audio narratives in support of cognitive skills training.<br/><br/><div class=\"awards-piece\"><div class=\"profileModuleRight\"><div class=\"contactInformation\">"]}
