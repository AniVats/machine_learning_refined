I also am Director of the Information Retrieval and Data Science Group (IRDS) and Adjunct Associate Professor in the Computer Science Department within USC's Viterbi School of Engineering.<br/> <br/> At USC, I teach CSCI 599: Content Detection and Analysis for Big Data, a new course in the Data Science track. I used to teach CSCI 572: Information Retrieval and Search Engines and CSCI 578: Software Architectures. See theTeaching section below for more information. In case you are interested in my other work, my CV is available here. I also have a research statement that describes my vision for data science in terms of my existing training, and where I'm headed. You can also check out my Ph.D. dissertation.<br/> <br/> I wrote the Tika in Action book with Jukka Zitting and published by Manning Publications. Tika in Action is the definitive guide to a popular software framework for content detection and analysis that I co-inveneted (with J\u00e9r\u00f4me Charron) called Apache Tika. We followed Doug's model of naming the framework after one of our child's favorite stuffed toys. <br/> <br/><br/><div class=\"research-piece\"><h4>Research Summary</h4><hr/>Software Architecture, Software Engineering, Search Engines, Information Retrieval, Resource Discovery, Distributed Computing Platforms, Large-scale, distributed systems, Data modeling, design and development of distributed data intensive systems<br/><br/><div class=\"awards-piece\">"]}
