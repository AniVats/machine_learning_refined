He received his first degree from the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of National Technical University of Athens, Greece, in June 1997, the M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University, California, in January 1999, and the Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University in December 2002. <br/> <br/> Konstantinos models and analyzes the performance of a variety of wired and wireless networks and designs schemes and protocols to solve problems related to such systems, including WiFi and cellular systems, data centers, sensor and IoT wireless networks etc. He is the author of more than 100 research papers on these topics which have received more than 10000 citations. Konstantinos has received faculty awards/grants from numerous governmental sources including the National Science Foundation and the Army Research Laboratory and from numerous companies including CISCO Systems and Huawei Communications. He has been a Stanford graduate fellow throughout his graduate studies and has received the best-student National Technical University of Athens award for graduating first in his class. He is an IEEE Fellow and a senior member of ACM.<br/><br/><div class=\"research-piece\"><h4>Research Summary</h4><hr/>My research interests lie in the area of Networking which fascinates me for its breadth, spanning from hands-on system-design all the way to advanced mathematical analysis, and for the direct impact that it has to people's lives, exemplified by the profound changes that the Internet, the World Wide Web, and the cellular/WiFi networks have brought to our lives.<br/> <br/> Broadly, networking research has two flavors. First, ``system-design'' research is mainly about protocol and algorithmic design, implementation and experimentation. Second, ``network-theory'' research is mainly about performance analysis using mathematical tools. The research I enjoy most is a combination of these two, stemming from my desire to apply formal analytical and algorithmic methods to problems of high practical relevance, and propose and implement/prototype solutions that can be used in practice.<br/> <br/> Since I joined USC I have modeled and analyzed the performance of a variety of networks, including the Internet, cellular and WiFi networks, IoT and sensor networks, data center networks, mobile ad hoc networks, delay and disruptive tolerant networks, mesh networks, peer to peer networks and the web. I have also designed and prototyped methods, algorithms, and protocols to solve problems related to such systems.
