He is currently at Amazon, on leave from his position of Professor of CS at USC. He served as Chairman of the Computer Science Department from 2001 to 2007. He has published 4 books, many articles, and is the recipient of 18 patents.<br/> <br/> Prof. Medioni is on the editorial board of several journals, and served as Chair of many conferences (CVPR, ICCV, WACV, ICPR).<br/> <br/> He is a Fellow of IAPR, a Fellow of the IEEE, and a Fellow of AAAI.<br/><br/><div class=\"research-piece\"><h4>Research Summary</h4><hr/>My research interests span a broad spectrum of the Image Understanding field. The issues of representation and matching lie at the core of it, leading to the following questions:<br/> How can we infer descriptions of objects (world-centered) from images (viewer-centered)? How can we \"recognize\" objects we have never seen before?<br/> In addition, I am interested in the design and implementation of very reliable vision systems to accomplish difficult tasks, using imperfect modules.<br/> <br/> I am also interested in establishing bridges between Computer Vision and Computer Graphics.<br/><br/><div class=\"awards-piece\">"]}
