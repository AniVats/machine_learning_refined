He is also the director of Intelligence and Knowledge Discovery (INK) Research Lab, the Information Director of ACM Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (SIGKDD), and member of USC Machine Learning Center, CAIS Center for AI in Society, and ISI Center on Knowledge Graphs. Priorly, he was a research scholar at Stanford University, and received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Prof. Ren's research leads to a book entitled \"Mining Structures of Factual Knowledge from Text: An Effort-Light Approach\" and over 50 research publications in top conferences and journals, was covered in over 10 conference tutorials (KDD, WWW, NAACL). Technologies he developed has been transferred to US Army Research Lab, National Institute of Health, Microsoft, Yelp and TripAdvisor.<br/><br/><div class=\"research-piece\"><h4>Research Summary</h4><hr/>Xiang Ren's research interests span machine learning and natural language processing, with a focus on developing label-efficient, prior-informed models that extract machine-actionable knowledge (e.g., compositional, graph-structured representations) from natural-language text data, as well as performing neural reasoning over symbolic knowledge. I'm particularly excited about problems in the space of modeling sequential/graph-structured data with weak supervision and prior knowledge. This includes neural-symbolic learning, learning with noisy data, zero/few-shot learning, and transfer learning.<br/><br/><div class=\"awards-piece\">"]}
