I am a member of the Natural Language Dialogue Group at the USC Institute for Creative Technologies. Previously I was a Research Scientist in the Natural Language Processing and Speech Research Group at the Educational Testing Service, and before that a Research Fellow in the Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation at the School of Informatics of the University of Edinburgh. <br/><br/><div class=\"research-piece\"><h4>Research Summary</h4><hr/>My research focuses on natural language processing and artificial intelligence with a particular interest in spoken dialogue processing. The underlying concept behind my research work is how to make spoken dialogue systems more human-like, robust to errors and misunderstandings, and adaptive to different types of human users and situations. My research interests include all aspects of spoken dialogue processing with a focus on statistical dialogue management (reinforcement learning of dialogue policies), expressive conversational speech synthesis, and speech recognition.<br/><br/><div class=\"awards-piece\"><div class=\"profileModuleRight\"><div class=\"contactInformation\">"]}
