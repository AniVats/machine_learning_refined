After spending a year in the Indian subcontinent as a Thomas J Watson Fellow, I joined Queen's University in Ontario and worked with Dr. Carolyn Small. The research for my Masters Degree in Mechanical Engineering at Queen's focused on developing non-invasive methods to estimate the kinematic integrity of the wrist joint.<br/> In 1991, I joined the doctoral program in the Design Division of the Mechanical Engineering Department at Stanford University. I worked with Dr. Felix Zajac developing a realistic biomechanical model of the human digits. This research, done at the Rehabilitation R &amp; D Center in Palo Alto, focused on predicting optimal coordination patterns of finger musculature during static force production.<br/> <br/> After completing my doctoral degree in 1997, I joined the core faculty of the Biomechanical Engineering Division at Stanford University as a Research Associate and Lecturer. In 1999, I joined the faculty of the Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Cornell University as Assistant Professor, and was tenured in 2005. In 2007, I joined the faculty at the Department of Biomedical Engineering, and the Division of Biokinesiology &amp; Physical Therapy at the University of Southern California as Associate Professor; where I was promoted to Full Professor in 2011. In 2013 I was elected Senior Member of the IEEE, and in 2014 to the College of Fellows of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineers. <br/><br/><div class=\"research-piece\"><h4>Research Summary</h4><hr/>Biomedical Engineering, Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy, Neuromuscular systems, Neural Motor Control, Biomechanics, Biomechanical modeling, Robotics, EMG, fMRI, Human and Robotic Manipulation, Nonlinear sytems<br/><br/><div class=\"awards-piece\">"]}
