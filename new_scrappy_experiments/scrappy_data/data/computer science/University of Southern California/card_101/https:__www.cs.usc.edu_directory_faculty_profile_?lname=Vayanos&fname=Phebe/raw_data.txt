Prior to joining USC, I was a lecturer in the Operations Research and Statistics Group at the MIT Sloan School of Management, and a postdoctoral research associate in the Operations Research Center at MIT. I hold a PhD degree in Operations Research and an MEng degree in Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineering, both from Imperial College London.<br/><br/><div class=\"research-piece\"><h4>Research Summary</h4><hr/>My research aims to address fundamental questions in data-driven optimization (a.k.a. prescriptive analytics) with aim to tackle real-world decision- and policy-making problems in uncertain and adversarial environments. My work is motivated by resource allocation problems that are important for social good, such as those arising in public health, public safety and security, public housing, biodiversity preservation, and education. I am also interested in issues surrounding fairness, efficiency, and interpretability in resource allocation. My aim is to advance research in Operations Research and Artificial Intelligence in a manner that will benefit society and in particular low resource communities and others that have not benefited from these recent developments.<br/><br/><div class=\"awards-piece\"><div class=\"profileModuleRight\"><div class=\"contactInformation\">"]}
