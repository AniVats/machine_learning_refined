At USC, he founded the B.S. in Computer Science (Games), the M.S. in Computer Science (Game Development), and the USC Games joint Advanced Games course and took that program from no program to the #1 Games program in the world. That program has been rated #1 by the Princeton Review for nine of the last ten years. His alums have shipped games played by over 5 billion players, about $250B in revenue. <br/> From Fall 2000 to Fall 2004, he was the Founding Director of the MOVES (modeling, virtual environments, and simulation) Institute located at the Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, and a Professor in the Department of Computer Science at NPS as well. At NPS, Zyda\u2019s NPSNET Research Group built the first networked virtual environment with fully instrumented body suits that played across the Internet. His work on the networking of virtual environments contributed to the development of the IEEE 1278.1 standard for distributed interactive simulation. <br/> He was a member of the National Research Council Committee that put out the report \u201cVirtual Reality - Scientific and Technological Challenges\u201d. He chaired the NRC Committee that put out the study \u201cModeling and Simulation - Linking Entertainment and Defense\u201d. That NRC report changed the entire Department of Defense towards the usage of games and entertainment technology for its future modeling and simulation systems. From that report, Zyda wrote the operating plan and research agenda that founded USC\u2019s Institute for Creative Technologies.<br/><br/><div class=\"research-piece\"><h4>Research Summary</h4><hr/>Professor Zyda is a pioneer in the following fields - computer graphics, networked virtual reality, modeling and simulation, and serious games. <br/> Zyda was Associate Editor and then Senior Editor for the MIT Press Journal Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments from 1993 - 2004. With Fred Brooks and Henry Fuchs, he co-founded the ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics in 1990.<br/> For the National Research Council, he has served on committees for the Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education Commission, the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board, the Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board, the Mathematical Sciences and Their Applications Board, the Naval Studies Board, the Air Force Studies Board, the Army Research Laboratory Technical Assessment Board, the Board on Higher Education and Workforce, the Board on Behavioral, Cognitive, and Sensory Sciences, and the Board on Earth Sciences and Resources.<br/> Zyda holds a lifetime appointment as a National Associate of the National Academies, an appointment made by the Council of the National Academy of Sciences in November 2003, awarded in recognition of \u201cextraordinary service\u201d to the National Academies. <br/> In May 2017, Zyda was appointed a member of the National Academy of Inventors in recognition of advanced technological development and innovation as issued by the United States Patent &amp; Trademark Office.<br/> In March 2017, Zyda was awarded the IEEE Virtual Reality Technical Achievement Award for fundamental work in virtual reality networking, body tracking &amp; institutionalizing the application of virtual reality.<br/> In November 2018, he was promoted to IEEE Fellow with the citation \u201cfor contributions to game design and networking\u201d.<br/> Zyda is a member of the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences. He served as the principal investigator and development director of the America\u2019s Army PC game funded by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs. He took America\u2019s Army from conception to three million plus registered players and hence, transformed Army recruiting. The creation of the America\u2019s Army game founded the serious games field. He co-holds two patents that form the basis for the nine-axis sensor in the Nintendo Wii U.<br/><br/><div class=\"awards-piece\">"]}
