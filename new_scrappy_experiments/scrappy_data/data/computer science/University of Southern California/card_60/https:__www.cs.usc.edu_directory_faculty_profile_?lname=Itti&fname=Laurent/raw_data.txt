He has since then been an Assistant, Associate, and now Full Professor of Computer Science, Psychology, and Neuroscience at the University of Southern California.<br/> <br/> Dr. Itti's research interests are in biologically-inspired computational vision, in particular in the domains of visual attention, scene understanding, control of eye movements, and surprise. This basic research has technological applications to, among others, video compression, target detection, and robotics. Dr. Itti has co-authored over 150 publications in peer-reviewed journals, books and conferences, three patents, and several open-source neuromorphic vision software toolkits<br/><br/><div class=\"research-piece\"><h4>Research Summary</h4><hr/>Computational neuroscience, theory of computation<br/><br/><div class=\"awards-piece\">"]}
