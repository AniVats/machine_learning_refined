Prior to that she was an Assistant Professor and then an Associate Professor at the University of Maryland at College Park and an Assistant Professor at Columbia University. Leana received her Ph.D. from UCLA. Her research interests are broadly in the design and evaluation of large scale distributed systems, with emphasis on analysis techniques needed for rapid evaluation of design ideas that lead to insight about systems' performance and reliability. She is a past Chair, Vice Chair, and Board of Directors member of ACM SIGMETRICS (special interest group on performance evaluation), and a past editor of the ACM Performance Evaluation Review. She has served as a program co-chair and general chair of ACM SIGMETRICS, program chair of Performance, program co-chair of MIS, a co-chair of HotMetrics, and is also on the Editorial Board of the Performance Evaluation journal and the ACM Transactions on Modeling and Performance Evaluation of Computing Systems. Leana received several awards, including the IBM Faculty Award, the NSF CAREER award, the Okawa Foundation award, and the IBM &amp; NSF Doctoral Fellowships. She is a member of the IFIP WG 7.3 (elected in 2000) and Tau Beta Pi. Leana also currently serves as USC's Director of the WiSE (Women in Science and Engineering) program and is the recipient of the WTS-LA Diversity Leadership Award and the USC Remarkable Women Award.<br/><br/><div class=\"research-piece\"><h4>Research Summary</h4><hr/>Research focus: computer systems modeling and performance evaluation with applications in distributed systems design<br/><br/><div class=\"awards-piece\">"]}
