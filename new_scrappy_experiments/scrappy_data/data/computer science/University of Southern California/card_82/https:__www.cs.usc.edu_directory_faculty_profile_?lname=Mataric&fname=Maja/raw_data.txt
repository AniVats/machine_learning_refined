Prof. Mataric' is actively involved in K-12 outreach, having received federal and corporate grants for developing free curricular materials for elementary and middle-school robotics courses in order to engage student interest in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) topics. Her Interaction Lab's research into socially assistive robotics is aimed at endowing robots with the ability to help people through individual assistance (for convalescence, rehabilitation, training, and education) and team cooperation (for habitat monitoring and emergency response).

It inspired by the dual goals of 1) gaining novel insights into human behavior and cognition through human-machine interaction and 2) developing robotic systems capable of providing personalized assistance individually (in convalescence, rehabilitation, training, and education) or in teams (in habitat monitoring and emergency response). Her Interaction Lab focuses on socially assistive systems capable of aiding people through social interaction rather than through physical contact. The research involves intelligent human-robot interaction (HRI), control, and learning in complex, dynamic, and uncertain environments by integrating on-line perception, representation, and interaction with people. To address the inherently multidisciplinary challenges of this research area, her work draws on theories, models, and collaborations from neuroscience, cognitive science, social science, health sciences, and education.<br/> <br/> The Interaction Lab projects focus on assistive human-robot interaction. Under the unbrella of socially assistive robotics, the group also pursues projects in humanoid control and learning through interaction, imitation and demonstration; and activity modeling for individuals, small groups, and crowds. Prof. Mataric's earlier work focused on synthesis and analysis of adaptive group behavior for distributed multi-robot control and learning.<br/><br/><div class=\"awards-piece\">"]}
