I was previously the Andrew and Erna Viterbi Early Career Chair in the Computer Science Department at the University of Southern California, where I ran a networking and systems research group with my colleagues Ramesh Govindan, and Wyatt Lloyd. Wyatt and I continue to collaborate with students in an initiative to specialize distributed systems and networking for the large applications deployed by today's leading content providers.<br/><br/><div class=\"research-piece\"><h4>Research Summary</h4><hr/>My primary interests are in networks and distributed systems. My goal is to improve the reliability and performance of Internet services. To understand the problem space, I look to the needs of operators and providers, and I conduct detailed network measurements. Based on what I learn, I design deployable systems to improve the Internet and services that run over it. I focus on the two components needed for reliably fast Internet services: (1) the Internet must provide reliable, high performance routes for traffic, and (2) we need to architect quality services and protocols to use these routes, to take advantage of the Internet's strengths and mask its limitations. These days, I am particularly interested in the problems that affect some of the dominant players on the Internet, including cloud providers, large content providers and content delivery networks, and mobile providers. The properties of these networks allow for tailored solutions, and I want to understand the properties and design the solutions.<br/><br/><div class=\"awards-piece\">"]}
