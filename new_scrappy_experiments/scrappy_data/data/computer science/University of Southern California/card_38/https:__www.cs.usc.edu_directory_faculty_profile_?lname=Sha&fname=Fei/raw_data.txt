Prior to joining USC, I was a postdoctoral researcher at U. of California (Berkeley) with Prof. Michael I. Jordan and Prof. Stuart Russell. I also spend a year at Yahoo! Research as a research scientist. I have a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in biomedical engineering from Southeast University (Nanjing, China). , and a Ph.D. in Computer and Information Sciences from the University of Pennsylvania, under the supervision of Prof. Lawrence K. Saul (now at UC San Diego)<br/><br/><div class=\"research-piece\"><h4>Research Summary</h4><hr/>My research focuses on the theory and application of machine learning. In the past, I have been working on a number of research projects including speech and object recognition, manifold learning and dimensionality reduction, optimization algorithms for large margin classifiers, and others. <br/> <br/> Recently, I have been interested in applying machine learning techniques to understanding human perception and cognitive processes by modeling and analyzing brain imaging data. I have also been actively working on computer vision problems with my collaborators.<br/> <br/> I was selected as a Sloan Research Fellow. I was also awarded an Army Research Office Young Investigator Award in 2012 and was a member of 2010 DARPA Computer Science Study Panel.<br/><br/><div class=\"awards-piece\">"]}
