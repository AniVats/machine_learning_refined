He is a faculty associate of the Institute for Software Research (ISR) at the University of California, Irvine.  Medvidovic received his Ph.D. in 1999 from the Department of Information and Computer Science at UC Irvine. He also received an M.S. in Information and Computer Science in 1995 from UC Irvine, and a B.S. in Computer Science summa cum laude in 1992 from the Computer Science and Engineering Department at Arizona State University. Medvidovic is a recipient of the National Science Foundation CAREER (2000) and ITR (2003) awards, as well as the Okawa Foundation Research Grant (2005) and IBM Real-Time Initiative Faculty Award (2007). Medvidovic's paper on Architecture-Based Runtime Software Evolution, which appeared in the Proceedings of the 1998 International Conference on Software Engineering, was named in May 2008 that conference's Most Influential Paper. His paper on Continuous Analysis of Collaborative Design received the Best Paper Award at the 2017 IEEE International Conference on Software Architecture. Medvidovic is an ACM Distinguished Scientist and an IEEE Fellow.<br/><br/><div class=\"research-piece\"><h4>Research Summary</h4><hr/>Medvidovic's research interests are in the area of architecture-based software development. His work focuses on software architecture modeling and analysis; middleware facilities for architectural implementation; product-line architectures; architectural styles; and architecture-level support for software development in highly distributed, mobile, resource constrained, and embedded computing environments.<br/><br/><div class=\"awards-piece\">"]}
