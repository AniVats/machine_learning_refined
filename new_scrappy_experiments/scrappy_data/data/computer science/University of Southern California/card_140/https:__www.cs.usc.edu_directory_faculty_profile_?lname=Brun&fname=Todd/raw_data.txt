Since then, he has worked at the University of London, the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Santa Barbara, Carnegie Mellon University, and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.  He joined the faculty of USC in 2003.  He was promoted to Associate Professor in 2006 and Full Professor in 2013.  His primary appointment is in the Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, with joint appointments in the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Physics and Astronomy.<br/> <br/> At USC, Prof. Brun has served as Associate Chair of Electrical Engineering (2007-2009), and as Vice Chair (2015/16) and Chair (2018-2020) of the Engineering Faculty Council.  In the latter capacities he also served on the USC Academic Senate as a Senator from the Viterbi School of Engineering.  Outside of USC, Prof. Brun was the Vice Chair (2016), Chair Elect (2017), Chair (2018) and Past Chair (2019) of the American Physical Society's Division of Quantum Information.<br/><br/><div class=\"research-piece\"><h4>Research Summary</h4><hr/>Brun works in the areas of quantum computation and quantum information theory.  He is especially interested in quantum open systems, decoherence, and the effects of environmental noise on quantum information processing and quantum error correction.  He has done recent work on fault-tolerant quantum computation, entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes, quantum walks, continuous measurements and quantum control, orbital angular momentum of photons, weak measurements, quantum mechanics with closed timelike curves, and the arrow of time.<br/><br/><div class=\"awards-piece\">"]}
