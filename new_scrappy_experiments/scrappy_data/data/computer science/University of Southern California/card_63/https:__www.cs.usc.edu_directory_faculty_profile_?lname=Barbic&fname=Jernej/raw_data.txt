He received the computer science Ph.D. degree from Carnegie Mellon University, in 2007. He was a postdoctoral researcher at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, from 2007 to 2009. He joined the Computer Science Department faculty at the University of Southern California in August 2009. In 2015, he was promoted to Associate Professor (with tenure).<br/><br/><div class=\"research-piece\"><h4>Research Summary</h4><hr/>I work in computer graphics, tackling interdisciplinary problems from computer animation, graphics, simulation, mechanics, haptics, control and acoustics. The main focus of my research is physically based simulation at real-time rates, for use in film industry, computer games, interactive CAD/CAM (airplane/automobile manufacturing), and virtual medicine (surgery simulation). My interests include computer graphics, animation, real-time simulation, numerical mathematics, the Finite Element Method, applied mechanics, collision detection, contact, haptic rendering, sound simulation, and model reduction and control of nonlinear systems. Of course, my interests are not limited just to these topics; I like computer graphics, numerical methods, computer science, and applied mathematics in general.<br/><br/><div class=\"awards-piece\">"]}
