His research focuses on the mathematical foundations of human-robot interaction, drawing upon expertise on machine learning, algorithmic game theory and decision making under uncertainty. His work leads to end-to-end solutions that enable deployed robotic systems to act optimally when interacting with people in practical, real-world applications. Previously, Stefanos completed his PhD at Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Institute and received his MS from MIT. He has also a MEng from the University of Tokyo and a BS from the National Technical University of Athens. Stefanos has worked as a research associate at the University of Washington, as a research specialist at MIT and as a researcher at Square Enix in Tokyo. He has received a Best Enabling Technologies Paper Award from the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction in 2015, a best paper nomination from the same conference in 2018 and was a best paper award finalist in the International Symposium on Robotics 2013.<br/><br/><div class=\"research-piece\"><h4>Research Summary</h4><hr/>Stefanos Nikolaidis directs the Interactive and Collaborative Autonomous Robotic Systems (ICAROS) lab, which focuses on the core computational challenges in human-robot interaction: what are good models of human behavior, how to learn such models from noisy samples, and how to robustly generate actions for robotic teammates in large scale real-world applications. Research in ICAROS spans the whole spectrum of human-robot interaction science: from distilling the fundamental mathematical principles that govern interactive behaviors, to developing approximation algorithms for deployed robotic systems and testing them \"in the wild\" with actual end users.<br/><br/><div class=\"awards-piece\"><div class=\"profileModuleRight\"><div class=\"contactInformation\">"]}
