His current research has two major themes.  The first theme is focused on making fundamental advances in the robotics area to enable deployment of robots on non-repetitive tasks in manufacturing. His group is developing a hybrid assembly cell where humans and robots can safely and efficiently collaborate to perform mechanical assembly tasks. This new assembly method is enabled by new real time planning and perception algorithms developed by his group. It enables leveraging complementary strengths of humans and robots in assembly tasks. His group is also making advances in a new manufacturing process called in-mold assembly by integrating customized robots inside the mold to eliminate post-molding assembly operations. Material is assembled in the liquid form during the in-mold assembly process, and hence articulated multifunctional structures that would have been otherwise impossible to realize can be made using this new process. <br/> <br/> The second theme of Prof. Gupta\u2019s research is focused on exploiting advances in manufacturing processes to design and manufacture novel robots. His group has utilized in-mold assembly and additive manufacturing processes to realize robotic birds. The use of new manufacturing processes enabled his group to significantly reduce the weight of the structural components and realize a platform called Robo Raven, which uses independent wing control to perform aerobatics and is able to harvest solar energy using multi-functional wings. His group has also investigated how to use 3D printing to realize a robot that uses limbless locomotion. The current version of robot is able to achieve high speed by utilizing exaggerated rectilinear gait enabled by a novel 3D printed parallel mechanism.<br/><br/><div class=\"awards-piece\">"]}
