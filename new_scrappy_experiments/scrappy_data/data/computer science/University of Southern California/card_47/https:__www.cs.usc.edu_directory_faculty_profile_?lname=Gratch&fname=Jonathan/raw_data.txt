He completed his Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Illinois in Urban-Champaign in 1995.  Dr. Gratch\u2019s research focuses on computational models of human cognitive and social processes, especially emotion, and explores these models\u2019 role in shaping human-computer interactions in virtual environments. He studies the relationship between cognition and emotion, the cognitive processes underlying emotional responses, and the influence of emotion on decision making and physical behavior. He is the founding and current Editor-in-Chief of IEEE\u2019s Transactions on Affective Computing (3.5 impact factor in 2013), Associate Editor of Emotion Review and the Journal of Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, and former President of the Association for the Advancement of Affective Computing (AAAC). He is a AAAI Fellow, a SIGART Autonomous Agent\u2019s Award recipient, a Senior Member of IEEE, and member of the International Society for Research on Emotion (ISRE).

Specifically, I investigate how algorithms can control the behavior of characters in virtual worlds, endowing them with an ability to think and engage in socio-emotional interactions with human users, using both verbal and nonverbal communication. Such methods can deepen our understanding of human behavior, by instantiating and systematically manipulating psychological theories. They also have wide application to such areas as training, entertainment and clinical diagnosis, assessment and treatment.<br/><br/><div class=\"awards-piece\">"]}
