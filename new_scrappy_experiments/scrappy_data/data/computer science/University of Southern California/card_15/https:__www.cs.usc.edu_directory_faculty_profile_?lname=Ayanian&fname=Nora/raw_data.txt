Her research focuses on creating end-to-end solutions for coordinating teams of robots that start from truly high-level specifications and deliver code for individual robots in the team, such as using simple multitouch inputs to control a team of UAVs. Ayanian brings a unique approach to multirobot systems, creating unified solutions that address task assignment, path planning, and control that are broadly applicable across all aspects of multirobot systems and mobile sensor networks. Her solutions provide guarantees of convergence and safety on real robotic systems. She won the Best Student Paper Award at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation 2008 for her work on constrained multirobot control, and with her collaborators, Best Paper in Robotics Track at the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling. She was named one of IEEE Intelligent Systems \"AI's 10 to watch\" (2013), NerdScholar's \"40 Under 40: Professors who Inspire\" (2014), and was part of the inaugural Mic 50 (2015), Mic.com's list of 50 influential young people, and MIT Technology Review's \"35 Innovators under 35\" (TR35, 2016). In 2016, she was received the NSF CAREER award and the Okawa Foundation Research Grant. Ayanian is a co-founder and current co-chair of the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society Technical Committee on Multi-Robot Systems.<br/> <br/> <br/><br/><div class=\"research-piece\"><h4>Research Summary</h4><hr/>Ayanian's research focuses on the question: How can we enable almost anyone to use teams of robots? To that end, Ayanian studies and\u00a0develops\u00a0end-to-end solutions for coordinating teams of robots, combining automation and artificial intelligence to create new kinds of autonomy.\u00a0These solutions take very high level specifications, such as simple multi-touch input from a tablet, and provide automated code delivery to all robots in the team.\u00a0By applying AI and studying human interaction, robots work collaboratively and accomplish tasks autonomously.\u00a0 Her solutions are broadly applicable\u00a0across all aspects of multi-robot systems and mobile sensor\u00a0networks, including manufacturing, warehousing, environmental monitoring, precision agriculture, and emergency response. <br/> <br/> Some of her work is featured on her lab's YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KIa9FlmbRc<br/><br/><div class=\"awards-piece\">"]}
