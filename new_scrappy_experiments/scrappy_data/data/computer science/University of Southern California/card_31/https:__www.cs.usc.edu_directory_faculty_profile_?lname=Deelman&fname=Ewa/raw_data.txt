I research how to best support complex scientific applications on a variety of computational environments, including campus clusters, grids, and clouds. I have designed new algorithms for job scheduling, resource provisioning, and data storage optimization in the context of scientific workflows. <br/> Since 2000, I have been conducting research in scientific workflows and have been leading the design and development of the Pegasus software that maps complex application workflows onto distributed resources. Pegasus is used by a broad community of researchers in astronomy, bioinformatics, earthquake science, gravitational-wave physics, limnology, and others.<br/> I am also interested in issues of distributed data management, high-level application monitoring, and resource provisioning in grids and clouds.<br/> My research is funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health.<br/><br/><div class=\"research-piece\"><h4>Research Summary</h4><hr/>I have co-edited a book on scientific workflows: Workflows for e-Science: Scientific Workflows for Grids, Ian J. Taylor, Ewa Deelman, Dennis B. Gannon, Matthew Shields (Editors), Springer, 2007., and authored over 30 journal articles and 80 conference publications. <br/> I established an annual workshop in the field of scientific workflows: the Workshop on Workflows in Support of Large-Scale Science (WORKS). For the first two years (2006-2007) the workshop was co-located with HPDC. In 2008-2010 WORKS took place in conjunction with SuperComputing. In 2011 the workshop (WORKS\u201911) is at SC in Seattle, Washington.<br/> In May 2006 I co-chaired the NSF-funded Workshop on Challenges of Scientific Workflows, http://confluence.pegasus.isi.edu/display/workshop06/Home<br/> Before joining ISI in October of 2000, I was a Sr. Development Engineer in the Parallel Computing Laboratory at UCLA.<br/> In 1997 I received a PhD in Computer Science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. My work focused on \"Optimizing Parallel Discrete Event Simulation for Spatially Explicit Problems\"<br/><br/><div class=\"awards-piece\">"]}
