I have participated in the yearly ACM Special Interest Group Symposium on Computer Science Education, either as paper presenter, panelist, or workshop or tutorial presenter, since 1990, and was a member of the 1999 conference program committee. I serve on the editorial board of Computer Science Education, a primary forum for CS education research. I have coauthored papers presented at the biennial Empirical Studies of Programmers (ESP) conference and have served on the program committees of ESP and all the International Computing Education Research Workshops.My interests have long included online learning environments for programming instruction. More recently, I and my colleagues have developed several lab-centric courses, which trade lecture and discussion time for supervised hands-on lab time. All activities for these courses are delivered online, and include embedded assessments and online and o\u270fine collaboration as well as more traditional programming tasks. Ongoing work includes the testing of a lab-centric data structures course, development of tools for curriculum authoring, feedback gathering, and revision, along with analysis of class survey and performance data.\n                    \n</section>\n<section class=\"section publications\">"]}
