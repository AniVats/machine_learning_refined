They have growing impact in many other areas of science and engineering. They do not however, follow a closed or compact set of theoretical principles. In Yann Lecun's words they require \"an interplay between intuitive insights, theoretical modeling, practical implementations, empirical studies, and scientific analyses.\" This course attempts to cover that ground.
