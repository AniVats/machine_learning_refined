His thesis work concerned the design and implementation of algorithms for the Macsyma computer algebra system. He taught in the Mathematics department at MIT from 1971 to 1974 and then joined the Berkeley Computer Science faculty. He was instrumental in originating the work on Berkeley's VAX UNIX system, and led the development of the original Franz Lisp at Berkeley. He served on the Common Lisp design committee and on the IEEE 754 binary floating-point arithmetic standards committee. He served as Berkeley's Computer Science Chair from 1987 to 1990.He has been the principal investigator on grants from DOE, NSF, and many industrial firms. He has authored more than 75 technical papers, mostly on issues related to computer algebra, programming languages and environments, scientific applications, and document image analysis.\n                    \n</section>\n<section class=\"section publications\">\n</section>\n<section class=\"section publications\">"]}
