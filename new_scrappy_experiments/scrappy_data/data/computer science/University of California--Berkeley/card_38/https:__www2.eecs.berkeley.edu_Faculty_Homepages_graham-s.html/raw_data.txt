She received an A.B. in mathematics from Harvard University and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer  Science from Stanford University. Her research spans many aspects of programming language implementation, software tools, software development, environments, and high-performance computing.  As a participant in the Berkeley Unix project, she and her students built the Berkeley Pascal system and the widely used program profiling tool gprof.  Their paper on that tool was selected for the list of best papers from twenty years of the Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (1979-1999). She is a Member of the National Academy of Engineering, a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and an Eminent Member of Eta Kappa Nu. She was the founding editor-in-chief of the ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems.  Her honors include the ACM SIGPLAN Career Programming Language Achievement Award (2000), the ACM Distinguished Service Award (2006), the Harvard Medal (2008), the IEEE von Neumann Medal (2009), the Berkeley Citation (2009), the ACM/IEEE Ken Kennedy Award (2011), and the Computing Research Association Distinguished Service Award (2012). She was named a University of California Honored Woman of the CAL Community in 1995 and a Berkeley Fellow in 2011.  She has served on numerous advisory committees; among them, the U.S. President's Information Technology Advisory Committee (PITAC) and the Harvard Board of Overseers.  She served as the Chief Computer Scientist for the NSF-sponsored National Partnership for Advanced Computational Infrastructure (NPACI) from 1997 to 2005. She currently serves as Chair of the  NSF-sponsored Computing Community Consortium,  as the Vice-chair and Treasurer of the Board of Trustees of Cal Performances, as a member of the Harvard Corporation, and as a member of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST).\n                    \n</section>\n<section class=\"section publications\">\n</section>\n<section class=\"section publications\">"]}
