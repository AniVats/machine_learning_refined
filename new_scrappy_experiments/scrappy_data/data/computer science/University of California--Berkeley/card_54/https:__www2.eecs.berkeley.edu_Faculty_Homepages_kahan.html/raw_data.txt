He joined the Berkeley faculty in 1968 with a joint appointment in the Math Department and as a member of the new Computer Science Department in the College of Letters and Science--before it merged with the EECS Department in the College of Engineering in 1973.  He retired from the University in 2008.  Kahan was instrumental in creating the IEEE 754-1985 standard for floating-point computation in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  He developed a program called \"paranoia' in the 1980s to test for potential floating point bugs and developed the Kaham summation algorithm which helps minimize errors introduced when adding a sequences of finite precision floating point numbers.  Kahan won the ACM A.M. Turing Award in 1989.\n                    \n</section>\n<section class=\"section publications\">"]}
