{"email": [], "image": [], "research_blurb": ["Catalog Description: An introduction to digital and system design. The material provides a top-down view of the principles, components, and methodologies for large scale digital system design. The underlying CMOS devices and manufacturing technologies are introduced, but quickly abstracted to higher-levels to focus the class on design of larger digital modules for both FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays) and ASICs (application specific integrated circuits). The class includes extensive use of industrial grade design automation and verification tools for assignments, labs and projects.  \nThe class has two lab options: ASIC Lab (EECS 151LA) and FPGA Lab (EECS 151LB). Students must enroll in at least one of the labs concurrently with the class."]}
