{"email": [], "image": [], "research_blurb": [" This lab covers the design of modern digital systems with Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platforms.  A series of lab exercises provide the background and practice of digital design using a modern FPGA design tool flow.  Digital synthesis, partitioning, placement, routing, and simulation tools for FPGAs are covered in detail.  The labs exercises culminate with a large design project, e.g., an implementation of a full three-stage RISC-V processor system, with caches, graphics acceleration, and external peripheral components.  The design is mapped and demonstrated on an FPGA hardware platform."]}
