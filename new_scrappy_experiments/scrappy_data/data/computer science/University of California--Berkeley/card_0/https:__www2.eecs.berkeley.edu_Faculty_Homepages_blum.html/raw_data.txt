While\nstudying electrical engineering, he pursued his desire to understand thinking and brains by working in the\nneurophysiology laboratory of Dr. Warren S. McCulloch and Walter Pitts, then concentrated on\nmathematical logic and recursion theory for the insight it gave him on brains and thinking. He did his\ndoctoral work under the supervision of Artificial Intelligence pioneer Marvin Minsky, and earned a\nPh.D. from MIT in mathematics in 1964.Blum began his teaching career at MIT as an assistant professor of mathematics and, in 1968, joined the\nfaculty of the University of California at Berkeley. He became the Bruce Nelson University Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon in 2001. Blum has supervised the theses of 35 doctoral students who now pepper almost every major computer science department in the country. The many ground-breaking areas of theoretical computer science chartered by his academic descendants are legend.\n                    \n</section>\n<section class=\"section publications\">"]}
