{"email": [], "image": [], "research_blurb": ["Catalog Description: This course is a sequel to EECS C106A/Bioengineering C106A, which covers kinematics, dynamics and control of a single robot. This course  will cover dynamics and control of groups of robotic manipulators coordinating with each other and interacting with the environment.  Concepts will include an introduction to grasping and the constrained manipulation, contacts and force control for interaction with the environment. We will also cover active perception guided manipulation, as well as the manipulation of non-rigid objects. Throughout,  we will emphasize  design and  human-robot interactions, and applications to applications in manufacturing, service robotics,  tele-surgery, and locomotion."]}
