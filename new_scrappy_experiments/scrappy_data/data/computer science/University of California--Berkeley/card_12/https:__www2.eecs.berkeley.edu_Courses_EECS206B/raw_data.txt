{"email": [], "image": [], "research_blurb": ["Catalog Description: This course  is a sequel to EECS C106A/206A, which covers kinematics,\ndynamics and control of a single robot. This course will cover dynamics and control of groups of robotic\nmanipulators coordinating with each other and interacting with the environment. Concepts will include\nan introduction to grasping and the constrained manipulation, contacts and force control for interaction\nwith the environment. We will also cover active perception guided manipulation, as well as the\nmanipulation of non-rigid objects. Throughout, we will emphasize design and human-robot\ninteractions, and applications to applications in manufacturing, service robotics, tele-surgery, and\nlocomotion. "]}
