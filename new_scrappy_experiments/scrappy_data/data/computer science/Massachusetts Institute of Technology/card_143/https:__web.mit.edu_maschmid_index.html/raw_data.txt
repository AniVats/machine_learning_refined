The group has historically worked on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). Starting initially with a focus on mechanical devices (pressure, force, and acceleration sensors), the group evolved its focus over the years to medical applications (rare-cell isolation from blood), micro chemical systems, and micro-scale power (micro-turbines, micro-fuel cells, and energy harvesters). Along the way, the group has conducted basic research on new fabrication technologies including electrochemical etching methods, wafer bonding, deep reactive ion etching (DRIE), and printed materials."]}
