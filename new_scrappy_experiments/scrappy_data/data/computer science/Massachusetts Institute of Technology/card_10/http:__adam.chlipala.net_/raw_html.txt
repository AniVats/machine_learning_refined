We are empowering \"normal folks\" without programming training to create full-featured, database-backed web apps quickly.  Watch this space for a link to the company web site when one exists!

My traditional areas are <i>programming languages</i> and <i>formal methods</i>, but my interests have broadened to include other aspects of computer-system design and implementation.  I like the idea of doing clean-slate redesign of computing stacks with current security and privacy concerns front-and-center, which I do believe involves, in a central way, my traditional focus of <b>mechanized mathematical proofs</b>, especially with <a href=\"http://coq.inria.fr/\">the Coq proof assistant</a>.  However, I also spend a fair amount of time now thinking more generally about pleasant interfaces (e.g., hardware instruction sets, OS system-call interfaces, programming languages) and efficient implementations of hardware and software systems, including through tinkering with traditional boundaries between layers.</p>\n\n      <p>I try to organize my research group as something like a startup company looking to produce one convincing unified demo of a clean-slate-ish full-stack, practical computer system.  (Like startup companies, we expect to pivot often based on what we learn!)  We are looking at simple embedded applications now, where the scope of machine-checked proofs and unified interface redesign reaches from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register-transfer_level\">RTL</a> to relational specifications of network protocols.  I'm interested in recruiting students to contribute.  I do sometimes hire postdocs, though most of my recruiting strategy is centered on students (PhD, master's, undergrad).  Ideal candidates have strong backgrounds in both rigorous mathematical reasoning and software/hardware systems implementation.  There tends to be a bad match with students who use the word \"theory\" to describe their interests within programming languages or formal methods, to the point where our PhD program generally won't admit those people (they'd be better-served elsewhere!).  Current MIT students interested in working together should e-mail me, while for others I suggest following our normal PhD application process.</p>\n\n      <p>For a bit more info on what I work on, two low-time-investment overviews (of the mechanized-proofs part) are <a href=\"http://www.cccblog.org/2018/06/13/the-surprising-security-benefits-of-end-to-end-formal-proofs/\">my blog post on the surprising security benefits of formal proofs</a> and <a href=\"https://media.ccc.de/v/34c3-9105-coming_soon_machine-checked_mathematical_proofs_in_everyday_software_and_hardware_development\">video of a talk I gave at the 34th Chaos Communication Congress in December 2017</a>.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"box\">\n      <h2>Current Research</h2>\n\n      <table>\n        <tbody><tr>\n          <td>needs logo</td>\n          <td class=\"project\"><i>Unnamed (and somewhat incipient) umbrella project to build demonstration software/hardware systems with end-to-end mechanized proofs.</i>  I started my time as faculty developing the <a href=\"https://github.com/mit-plv/bedrock\">Bedrock</a> library for verified multilanguage programming, but that project is largely over; we are working on a replacement project now that shares the name but makes very different design decisions, still supporting separation-logic-verified low-level programs (in a tasteful language, not C!) processed by a verified compiler, which I would like to use to explore alternative and drastically simplified OS-like functionality.  The programming layer on top is meant to involve our <a href=\"https://github.com/mit-plv/fiat\">Fiat</a> system for automatic and correct-by-construction program derivation from specifications, which we are currently experimenting with using to generate code for practical network servers, a convenient domain for trying to make high-level programming more like relational-database programming but without the usual rough edges.  Beneath the level of assembly language, we have work in the <a href=\"https://github.com/mit-plv/kami\">Kami</a> project on modular hardware verification and verified compilation, where development is proceeding now jointly with industry, and where I'm especially interested in exploring alternative concurrency support in general-purpose processors.  One of the cross-cutting focuses now is cryptography, including in our <a href=\"https://github.com/mit-plv/fiat-crypto\">Fiat Cryptography</a> project that centers on what is essentially a verified domain-specific compiler for finite-field arithmetic, which should soon be included in the build process for Google Chrome (to produce some of the code to validate SSL connections).</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://css.csail.mit.edu/fscq/\"><img class=\"project\" width=\"125\" height=\"95\" src=\"fscq.png\"></a></td>\n          <td class=\"project\"><a href=\"http://css.csail.mit.edu/fscq/\">FSCQ</a>, a file system verified in Coq using a separation logic for reasoning about crash safety, mostly carried out these days by colleagues in <a href=\"https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/\">the PDOS group</a></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td><a href=\"http://deepspec.org\"><img class=\"project\" alt=\"DeepSpec\" width=\"120\" src=\"http://deepspec.org/img/deepspec-logo-300dpi.png\"></a></td>\n          <td class=\"project\"><a href=\"http://deepspec.org/\"><strong>The Science of Deep Specification</strong></a>, a National Science Foundation Expedition in Computing, 2016-2021, promoting similar full-stack-verification research to what I described above, but on more conventional architectures</td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody></table>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"box\">\n      <h2>Some Old Research</h2>\n\n      <table>\n        <tbody><tr>\n          <td><a href=\"http://www.impredicative.com/ur/\"><img class=\"project\" width=\"127\" height=\"99\" src=\"web.png\"></a></td>\n          <td class=\"project\"><a href=\"http://www.impredicative.com/ur/\">Ur/Web</a>, a domain-specific functional programming language for modern Web applications.

As a general starting point, I recommend <a href=\"http://robertwright.com/moral-animal/\"><i>The Moral Animal</i></a>.\n          <ul>\n            <li>An important subtopic is the roots of the ideological differences that divide us, which lately seem to be especially hard to dislodge.  <a href=\"https://righteousmind.com/\"><i>The Righteous Mind</i></a> explains how genes influence moral intuitions and makes a good case for not demonizing people with opposing intuitions.  (And, straying even more off-topic, for a fascinating [but North-America-specific] take on regional culture as another source of differences, see <a href=\"http://www.colinwoodard.com/americannations.html\"><i>American Nations</i></a>.)</li>\n        </ul></li>\n        <li>Many of the choices we make have significant <b>environmental</b> consequences, and it's important to have a sound scientific basis for evaluating them.  <a href=\"https://www.withouthotair.com/\"><i>Sustainable Energy -- Without the Hot Air</i></a> is a good source for the quantitative details.  The most striking takeaway for me was, for my own carbon footprint, the total dominance of air travel, which is why it's super-cool that there is a <a href=\"http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Climate/\">SIGPLAN Climate Change</a> committee now, to help us get this excessive conference-going under control.  (I'm in favor of one conference per research area per year, with as many parallel tracks as needed!)</li>\n        <li>One of the consequential kinds of choices we make is about <b>what to eat</b>.</li>\n        <ul>\n          <li>On the environmental-impact side, I have to admit I haven't found one book that summarizes the evidence and then makes recommendations without worrying too much about inertia and people's supposed unwillingness to change.  <a href=\"http://james-mcwilliams.com/?page_id=670\"><i>Just Food</i></a> is a start, though.</li>\n          <li>The standard American diet also has huge problems for promoting good health.  The best starter source of information there is <a href=\"https://nutritionfacts.org/book/\"><i>How Not to Die</i></a>.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <li>Our <b>transportation</b> customs (in the USA, at least) also have some remarkably bad but underappreciated consequences.  Personally, I support dramatically curtailing use of vehicles that run on roads, in favor of much more walking and vehicles that run on rails, which are fundamentally more energy-efficient (as I learned in <i>Without the Hot Air</i>).  For a fascinating analysis of the implicit subsidy on cars via legal minimum standards on parking spaces, see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_High_Cost_of_Free_Parking\"><i>The High Cost of Free Parking</i></a>.</li>\n        <li>There's a lot of hand-wringing these days about how hard it is to \"make it\" <b>financially</b> starting as a student.  That may very well be true, but for the elite audience likely to read this page, with strong skills in computing (broadly construed), things are pretty rosy.  The challenge and opportunity is to reconsider norms about how much <i>stuff</i> we really want in our lives, and whether it is worth the cost in money, health, and whatever else.  See the blog <a href=\"http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/02/22/getting-rich-from-zero-to-hero-in-one-blog-post/\"><i>Mr. Money Mustache</i></a> for a firehose of suggestions, or <a href=\"https://jlcollinsnh.com/2016/06/18/the-simple-path-to-wealth-is-now-published/\"><i>The Simple Path to Wealth</i></a> for a gentler introduction.</li>\n        <li>Finally, relatively on-topically, anyone out there who is into programming and hasn't yet tried proof assistants should seriously consider grabbing a good introduction like <a href=\"https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/\"><i>Software Foundations</i></a>!  This technology is going mainstream any year now, and in the mean time it's great fun and mental exercise, which I'd like to think prepares us for solid rational analysis of all sorts of big questions in the world.</li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"box\">\n      <a href=\"more.html\">More content and links....</a>\n    </div>\n\n\n</body></html>"
