In particular, we have been working on exploiting mathematical structure for discrete and combinatorial machine learning problems, for robustness and for scaling machine learning algorithms.\n\t\t      More details about my research can be found in these Our research is supported by a Sloan Research Fellowship, an NSF CAREER Award, a DARPA Young Faculty Award, an NSF  <p>Lectures at <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/events/ss2015/\">MSR Summer School</a> in Bangalore and <a href=\"http://www.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/mlss15\">MLSS Kyoto</a></p>  <p>We enjoyed the <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/events/neml2015\">New England Machine Learning Day</a>!</p>  "]}
