He has made architectural contributions to a number of VAX, Alpha and X86 processors and is recognized as one of the developers of the widely employed quantitative approach to processor performance evaluation. He has also been recognized for his contributions in the advancement of simultaneous multi-threading technology, analysis of the architectural impact of soft errors, memory dependence prediction, pipeline and cache organization, performance modeling methodologies and spatial architectures. His current research interests include memory hierarchy design, processor reliability, spatial architectures and performance modeling.Our research aims to scale hard-to-parallelize applications through new programming models and multicore architectures. Our goal is to enable"]}
