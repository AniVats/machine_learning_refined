Information is a fundamental quantity that, like energy, can be \nconverted from one form to another, transmitted from one place to another, or \nstored for later use.  One form of information in physical systems is known as \nentropy, a quantity that obeys one of the most profound and mysterious of all \nphysical laws, the Second Law of Thermodynamics.  By treating entropy as a form \nof information, we can make the Second Law accessible to freshmen.  They see \nexamples of reversible and irreversible processes in computation, \ncommunications, and thermodynamics.  The first offering of the new course \ntook place in Spring 2000, and since 2003 the course has been offered jointly by \nthe MIT Department of Mechanical Engineering and Department of Electrical \nEngineering and Computer Science.  More information is available from the \n<a href=\"http://www.mtl.mit.edu/Courses/6.050/index.html\">course home pages</a> \nfor years 2003, 2004, and 2005.\n</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>Narrative biography</h4>\n<p>\nProfessor Penfield was born May 28, 1933 in Detroit, Michigan.  He received the \nB.A. degree (cum laude) in \n<a href=\"http://www.amherst.edu/%7Ephysics/\">physics</a> from \n<a href=\"http://www.amherst.edu/\">Amherst College</a>, Amherst, Massachusetts in \n1955, and the Sc.D. degree in electrical engineering from \n<a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/\">MIT</a> in 1960.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe joined the MIT faculty, in the \n<a href=\"http://www.eecs.mit.edu/\">Department of Electrical Engineering and \nComputer Science</a> (EECS), in 1960.  He served as Associate Head of the \nDepartment from 1974 to 1978, and as Director of the Microsystems Research \nCenter from 1985 to 1989.  From 1989 to 1999 he served as Head of the \nDepartment.  He was Dugald C. Jackson Professor of Electrical Engineering from \nJanuary, 2000 until his retirement in June, 2005.\n</p>\n<p>\nHis technical interests have included solid-state microwave devices and \ncircuits, noise and thermodynamics, electrodynamics of moving media, circuit \ntheory, computer-aided design, APL language extensions, integrated-circuit \ndesign automation, and computer-aided fabrication of integrated circuits.\n</p>\n<p>\nProfessor Penfield is a Fellow of \n<a href=\"http://www.ieee.org/\">the Institute of Electrical and Electronics \nEngineers</a> (IEEE), and former Chairman of the Boston Section.  He received \nfrom IEEE the Centennial Medal in 1984, the Circuits and Systems Society \nDarlington Prize Paper Award in 1985, and the Circuits and Systems Society \nGolden Jubilee Award in 1999.  He is a member of the \n<a href=\"http://www.nae.edu/\">National Academy of Engineering</a> (NAE), the \n<a href=\"http://www.aps.org/\">American Physical Society</a> (APS), the \n<a href=\"http://www.aes.org/\">Audio Engineering Society</a> (AES), the \n<a href=\"http://www.acm.org/\">Association for Computing Machinery</a> (ACM), and \n<a href=\"http://www.sigmaxi.org/\">Sigma Xi</a>.  He is the author of five books \nand dozens of articles in his various fields of interest.  He has been a \nconsultant for many companies, and between 1980 and 1995 served as a Director of \nGenRad, Inc.  During 1996-97 he served as President of the \n<a href=\"http://www.ecedha.org/\">National Electrical Engineering Department \nHeads Association</a> (NEEDHA) and in March, 2000 received its Outstanding Service Award.  \nIn 1998 he received the Fellow Award from the \n<a href=\"http://www.iec.org/\">International Engineering Consortium</a>.  In 1998 \nhe organized the <a href=\"http://www.eecs.mit.edu/AY97-98/events/b20/\">Building 20 \nCommemoration</a>, to remember and honor MIT's Building 20, for which he \nreceived the 1999 Presidential Citation from The Association of Alumni and Alumnae \nof MIT.\n</p>\n<p>\nProfessor Penfield lives in Weston, Massachusetts with his wife Barbara.  He \nis a member of the <a href=\"http://www.visuallink.net/fern/\">American Fern \nSociety</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.hardyferns.org/\">Hardy Fern \nFoundation</a>, and has a particular interest in field identification of ferns, \nfern allies, and fern hybrids.\n</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n<font size=\"-1\" face=\"arial, helvetica, sans-serif\">\nVisits since Feb 17, 1997: 0 | \n<a href=\"/users/penfield/cgi/sitemap.cgi\">Site map</a> | \n<a href=\"/users/penfield/cgi/sitefind.cgi\">Search</a> | \n<a href=\"/users/penfield/cgi/sitemeta.cgi?meta=site\" target=\"meta\">About this site</a> | \n<a href=\"/users/penfield/cgi/sitemeta.cgi\" target=\"meta\">About this page</a> | \n<a href=\"/users/penfield/cgi/siteask.cgi\" target=\"ask\">Comments and inquiries</a>\n</font>\n</body></html>"
