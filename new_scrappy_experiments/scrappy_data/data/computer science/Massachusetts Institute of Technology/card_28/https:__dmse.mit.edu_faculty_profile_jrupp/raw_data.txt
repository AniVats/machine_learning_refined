Previously, she was a non-tenure track assistant professor at ETH Zurich Switzerland where she held two prestigious externally funded career grants, namely an ERC Starting Grant (SNSF) and Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) professorship.\nShe previously held positions as visiting and senior scientist at MIT (2012\u20132011) and\u00a0the National Institute of Materials Science (NIMS) in Tsukuba Japan (2011), and was a postdoc at ETH Zurich (2010\u20132006). The Rupp team's current research interests are on solid-state material design and tuning of structure\u2013property relations for novel energy and information devices and operation schemes. This ranges from alternative energy storage via solid state batteries, solar-to-synthetic fuel conversion or novel types of neuromorphic memories, and computing logic entities for data storage and transfer beyond transistors and new sensing functions to track chemicals in the environment. Here, her team goes the whole way from material design, novel processing techniques to make ceramics, cermets or glassy-type ceramic structures, up to novel device prototypes, their operation and characteristics.\u00a0\nShe has published more than 81 papers, holds 8 patents, and enjoys actively discussing material tech trends on the theme of energy with the public, economists, and policy makers, being a frequent speaker and panel member of the World Economic Forum.\nProfessor Rupp and her team have received several honors and awards such as Displaying Future Awards by the company Merck KGaA 2018 for a glucose converting fuel cell chip, BASF and Volkswagen Science Award 2017 for battery research, \u00a0\"Top 40 international scientist under the age of 40\" by World Economic Forum 2015, Spark Award for the most innovative and economically important invention of the year 2014 at ETH Zurich,\u00a0Kepler award \u201cnew materials in energy technology\u201d by the European Academy of Science 2012 or Young Scientist Award by the Solid State Ionic Society. She gave keynote lectures at Royal Society UK 2018, Nature Energy conference 2016, Gordon Research lecture 2014 and many others, also she presented on battery and energy technologies at the World Economic Forum 2017.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n<!-- /.column2 -->\n<!-- /.primary-info -->\n<div class=\"secondary-info\">\n<div aria-label=\"Recent news list\" class=\"news\">"]}
