My work focuses on high-efficiency computer graphics, at the intersection of graphics with systems, architecture, and compilers. I did my PhD with <a href=\"http://people.csail.mit.edu/fredo\">Fr\u00e9do Durand</a> and <a href=\"http://people.csail.mit.edu/saman\">Saman Amarasinghe</a> at <a href=\"http://csail.mit.edu\">MIT CSAIL</a> on the <a href=\"http://halide-lang.org\">Halide language</a>, have worked at three <a href=\"http://www.nvidia.com\">major</a> <a href=\"http://www.amd.com\">GPU</a> <a href=\"http://www.intel.com\">vendors</a> in architecture, compilers, and research, and built a <a href=\"lightspeed/\">real-time preview system</a> for the special effects industry in collaboration with <a href=\"http://www.ilm.com\">Industrial Light &amp; Magic</a>.\n<!--\nI am actively looking for great PhD students to join me. If you are interesting in applying systems, compilers, programming languages, and specialized architectures to graphics, vision, machine learning, and computational photography problems:\n\n1.
