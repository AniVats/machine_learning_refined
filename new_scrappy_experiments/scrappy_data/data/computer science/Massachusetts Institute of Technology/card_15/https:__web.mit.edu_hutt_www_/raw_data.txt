During the past few years I've primarily served in organizational leadership roles, leaving more limited time for research.\n<img alt=\"Image from Atlantic Article entitle Metamorphosis\" height=\"72\" src=\"atlantic-article.jpg\" width=\"72\"/><br/>Recently I've been concerned with how to develop a better understanding of AI, as exemplified in a co-authored piece in <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/08/henry-kissinger-the-metamorphosis-ai/592771/\">The Atlantic</a>. I also remain deeply interested in academic research in computer vision and social network analysis.\n\t\t\n<img alt=\"Image of segmentation results\" height=\"72\" src=\"segmentation.png\" width=\"72\"/>Over the years I've developed a number of algorithmically-oriented computer vision techniques. The super-pixel <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:VISI.0000022288.19776.77\">segmentation</a> method and <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/232073\">Hausdorff distance</a> methods that I helped create remain widely used, even in this era of deep learning. Hausdorff based image compression software that we created at Xerox nearly 25 years ago is also still used in document scanners.\n\t\t\n<img alt=\"Image of social network\" height=\"72\" src=\"social-network.png\" width=\"72\"/><br/>I worked on early studies of the first online social networks such as <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1150412\">group formation</a> on LiveJournal, and have continued to work on social network analysis.\n\t\t\n<img alt=\"Photo of autonomous car collision\" height=\"72\" src=\"auto-collision.png\" width=\"72\"/>I helped lead a team at Cornell that developed one of the first self-driving cars as part of the DARPA Urban Challenge. Our vehicle was involved in the first fully autonomous two-car <a href=\"https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/60040\">collision</a> during the race with the vehicle from MIT.\n\t\t\n\n<!--\t\t  \n\n         <div id=\"news\">\n            <h2>Creating the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</h2>\n            \n\n            \n            \n\n         \n               \n-->"]}
