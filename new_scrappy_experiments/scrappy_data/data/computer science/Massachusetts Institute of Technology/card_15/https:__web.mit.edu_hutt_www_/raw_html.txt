Previously he helped found Cornell Tech, the digital technology oriented graduate school created by Cornell University in New York City, and served as its first Dean and Vice Provost. His research and teaching have been recognized by a number of awards including ACM Fellow and CASE Professor of the Year. He has a mix of academic and industry background, having been a Computer Science faculty member at Cornell, researcher and manager at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), and CTO of a fintech startup. He currently serves as the board chair of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and as a member of the board of Corning Inc. and Amazon.com. He received his bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan, and master's and doctorate from MIT.\n</p>\n            </div> \n   </div>\n        \n\n        <div id=\"news\">\n        \t<h2>Research and Scholarship</h2>\n            \n\n\t\t<p><img src=\"cornell_tech.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of Cornell Tech\" width=\"72\" height=\"72\">My <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q16KVs0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">research</a> often bridges between academic subfields and between academia and industry. During the past few years I've primarily served in organizational leadership roles, leaving more limited time for research.</p>\n\n\t\t<p><img src=\"atlantic-article.jpg\" alt=\"Image from Atlantic Article entitle Metamorphosis\" width=\"72\" height=\"72\"><br>Recently I've been concerned with how to develop a better understanding of AI, as exemplified in a co-authored piece in <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/08/henry-kissinger-the-metamorphosis-ai/592771/\">The Atlantic</a>. I also remain deeply interested in academic research in computer vision and social network analysis.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t<p><img src=\"segmentation.png\" alt=\"Image of segmentation results\" width=\"72\" height=\"72\">Over the years I've developed a number of algorithmically-oriented computer vision techniques. The super-pixel <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:VISI.0000022288.19776.77\">segmentation</a> method and <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/232073\">Hausdorff distance</a> methods that I helped create remain widely used, even in this era of deep learning. Hausdorff based image compression software that we created at Xerox nearly 25 years ago is also still used in document scanners.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p><img src=\"social-network.png\" alt=\"Image of social network\" width=\"72\" height=\"72\"><br>I worked on early studies of the first online social networks such as <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1150412\">group formation</a> on LiveJournal, and have continued to work on social network analysis.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t<p><img src=\"auto-collision.png\" alt=\"Photo of autonomous car collision\" width=\"72\" height=\"72\">I helped lead a team at Cornell that developed one of the first self-driving cars as part of the DARPA Urban Challenge. Our vehicle was involved in the first fully autonomous two-car <a href=\"https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/60040\">collision</a> during the race with the vehicle from MIT.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\n        </div>\n\n<!--\t\t  \n\n         <div id=\"news\">\n            <h2>Creating the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</h2>\n            \n\n            <p>\n            </p>\n\n         </div>\n               \n-->\n    \n\n\n\n</div></body></html>"
