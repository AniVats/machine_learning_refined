I seek to obtain engineering insight into practically relevant problems by formulating and solving mathematical models. As part of this, I want to understand the relationship between combinatorial structure and computational tractability of high-\ndimensional inference in graphical models and other statistical models.", "", "\n    \n\n    Powered by the\n    Academic theme for\n    Hugo.\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"]}
