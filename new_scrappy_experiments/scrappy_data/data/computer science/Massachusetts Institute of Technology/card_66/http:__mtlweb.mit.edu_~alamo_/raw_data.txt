We design and fabricate our own prototype transistors at the facilities of the Microsystems Technology Laboratories at MIT. We then characterize their operation in our own measurement laboratory. We also study the reliability of transistors under prolonged electrical, thermal and environmental stress. We build models and carry out simulations in order to understand the underlying physics. All our research is performed in close connection with industrial partners.   Cross section of a self-aligned InGaAs Quantum-Well MOSFET with a gate length of 20 nm. This is one of the smallest III-V MOSFETs ever fabricated (research of Jerome Lim). "]}
