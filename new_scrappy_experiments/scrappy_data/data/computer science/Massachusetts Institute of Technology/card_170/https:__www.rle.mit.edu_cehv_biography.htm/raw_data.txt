He received all his education at MIT in the Department of Electrical Engineering from 1964-70. He then became a professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Florida, Gainesville until 1980 when he joined the MIT faculty. He works in the Research Laboratory of Electronics MIT Laboratory for Electromagnetic and Electronic Systems and High Voltage Research Laboratory where he does research on electromagnetic field interactions with materials and devices. He has received numerous awards for excellence in teaching and he is a Fellow of the IEEE for \"contributions to the understanding of the effects of space charge and flow electrification on the conduction and breakdown properties of dielectrics\". <br/>\n\nHe is the author of \u201cElectromagnetic Field Theory: A Problem Solving Approach\u201d first published \u00a0in 1979 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, and republished by Krieger Publishing Company in 1987 and 2003.\u00a0 He co-developed with James R. Melcher a set of educational videotapes on Demonstrations of Electromagnetic Fields and Energy for enriched teaching of electromagnetism. His fields of research and interest include electro-optical field and charge mapping measurements; high-voltage charge transport and breakdown phenomena in dielectrics; flow electrification phenomena in electric power apparatus; development of capacitive and inductive sensors for measuring profiles of dielectric, conduction, and magnetic properties of media including applications to measurements of physical properties such as moisture diffusion into transformer oil and pressboard insulation, and also for detection of buried dielectric, magnetic, and conducting devices such as land mines; and electrohydrodynamic, electrokinetic, and ferrohydrodynamic interactions with charged, polarizable, and magnetic fluids.\n<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->\n\n<div id=\"sidebarcontent\">\n<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name=\"Sidebar Image\" -->\n<img alt=\"Professor Markus Zahn\" height=\"237\" src=\"images/photo_zahn.jpg\" width=\"204\"/>\n<strong>Professor Markus Zahn</strong>\n\u00a0\n<em><a href=\"documents/Zahnbiography-April5-2012_000.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download full Word R\u00e9sum\u00e9</a></em>\n<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->\n\n<div id=\"footer\">\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;\">\u00a0\n<div id=\"footerleft\">\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\"><!-- #BeginLibraryItem \"/Library/bottomnav.lbi\" -->\n<a href=\"default.htm\">Home</a> \u2022 <a href=\"biography.htm\">Biography/R\u00e9sum\u00e9</a> \u2022 <a href=\"bookssolutionmanuals.htm\">Books/Manuals</a> \u2022 <a href=\"publications.htm\">Publications</a> \u2022 <a href=\"theses.htm\">Supervised Theses</a> \u2022 <a href=\"videos.htm\">Videos</a> \u2022 <a href=\"lectures.htm\">Lectures</a> \u2022 <a href=\"presentations.htm\">Presentations</a> \u2022 <a href=\"contact.htm\">Contact</a><!-- #EndLibraryItem -->\n\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;\">\u00a0\n<div id=\"footerright\">\n<script language=\"JavaScript\">\n<!--\n\n//Script created by Ronny Drappier, http://sipreal.com\n//Visit http://javascriptkit.com for this script\n\n    today=new Date();\n    y0=today.getFullYear();\n\n  // end hiding --->\n</script>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a9 <script language=\"JavaScript\">\n  <!--- Hide from old browsers\n    document.write(y0);\n  // end hiding --->\n</script>2020 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n\n<div id=\"footer\">\n<div id=\"footerleftlogo\">\n<a href=\"https://www.rle.mit.edu\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT\" border=\"0\" height=\"41\" src=\"images/rle_logo.gif\" width=\"179\"/></a>\n\n<div id=\"footerrightlogo\">\n<a href=\"http://web.mit.edu\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Massachusetts Institute of Technology\" border=\"0\" height=\"32\" src=\"images/mit_logo_color.gif\" width=\"58\"/></a>"]}
