In addition, novel biomechanical characterization techniques have been developed for measurements of the biochemical composition, mechanical properties, and gene and protein expression, AFM-based indentation, AFM-based wide bandwidth dynamic nanorheology to study the molecular-level contributions to biomechanical behavior and energy dissipation in mechanically loaded soft tissues."]}
