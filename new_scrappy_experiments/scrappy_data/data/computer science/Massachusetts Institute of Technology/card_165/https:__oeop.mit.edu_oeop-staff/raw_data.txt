Now in her current role as the Manager of Programs, she oversees the implementation of the OEOP\u2019s various outreach programs and manages relationships with internal and external partners that help support the OEOP\u2019s mission and work. Inspired by her own academic experience, Reimi is passionate about creating spaces in which students can learn from and support each other as they navigate pursuing their interests in STEM fields.Prior to joining the OEOP, Faika spent three years in the private sector in retirement services and most recently, worked as Program Coordinator within the department of Chemical Engineering coordinating the day-to-day finance and administration activities for an interdisciplinary research center. Faika holds a bachelor\u2019s degree in Business Administration from Suffolk University, and a Master of Divinity at Wake Forest University School of Divinity. Faika is a Boston native who in her spare time enjoys reading, binge watching tv shows, cooking, living out new and memorable experiences, and spending time with friends and family.Anahita Zare joined the OEOP in September 2017. As SEED Academy Program Administrator, she is responsible for the planning and execution of the local, academic year program including logistics, training and managing staff members, overall student well-being, and ensuring the program runs smoothly. Prior to joining the OEOP, Anahita worked to develop and implement various science outreach programs in Columbia, MO. Most notably,\u00a0Anahita was coordinator for the Chemistry Immersion Program (CHIP). CHIP is a two-week program whose goal is to increase student interest in STEM careers and boost retention in the STEM discipline by enhancing students' comfort levels in collegiate chemistry and\u00a0biochemistry.\u00a0Through Anahita\u2019s work with CHIP, the program has expanded to include over 135 students and teachers in 11 states. Anahita is also the co-host and producer of a national award-winning science radio show and podcast, The Big Electron, which has 2000+ listeners. The Big Electron is a science radio show which covers the interesting and relevant science and technology stories. Anahita\u2019s long-standing passion for science outreach began in high school and extends beyond these initiatives. Anahita is invigorated by her work at the OEOP because she hopes to live in a science-literate world where high quality STEM education is available to all.\u00a0Anahita holds a BS in Chemistry from Florida State University, and a PhD in Chemistry from the JiJi Lab at University of Missouri-Columbia on developing\u00a0biophysical spectroscopic techniques.\u00a0Anahita was born and raised in Florida, is a founding member of the OEOP 'A-Team', and spends her free time reading, being outdoors, and singing karaoke.Laura Beretsky joined the OEOP in March 2019. As Grant Writer she is responsible for raising money, writing proposals, and researching/cultivating new institutional donors.

She volunteers as Community Advisory Board Member for 88.9 WERS. In her spare time, she enjoys hiking, working on art and crafts projects, and exploring the food and music scenes in Boston.Professor Cardinal Warde is the Faculty Director of the OEOP. His main responsibility is the intellectual content of the programs offered by the OEOP. He is a professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and is one of the world\u2019s leading experts on materials, devices and systems for optical information processing and displays. Professor Warde's current research activities are centered on the development of: compact optoelectronic neural network co-processors for brain-like computing, light modulators and projection displays based on micro-electro-mechanical systems, and high-resolution, adaptive, wavefront-phase compensation systems for imaging and optical communications. He is the co-editor of one book, and the co-author of three book chapters on optical materials and devices. \u00a0In addition to publishing over one-hundred-fifty technical papers in these fields, he is the holder of twelve patents on spatial light modulators, displays and optical information processing systems."]}
