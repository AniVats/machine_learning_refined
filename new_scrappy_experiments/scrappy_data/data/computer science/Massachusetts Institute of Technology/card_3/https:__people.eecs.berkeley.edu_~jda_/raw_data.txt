My research aims to (1)\n    understand the computational foundations of efficient language learning,\n    and (2) build general-purpose intelligent systems that can communicate\n    effectively with humans and learn from human guidance.\n  : I do not currently have openings for\n    visiting researchers. (I'm afraid I generally can't respond to individual\n    emails about either grad admissions or visitor positions / internships.) \n  \n\n  Some current research directions:\n\n  \n      Much of humans' abstract knowledge comes from abstract descriptions, but\n      almost all machine learning research focuses on learning from\n      comparatively low-level demonstrations or interactions. How do we enable\n      more natural and efficient learning from natural language supervision\n      instead?\n    "]}
