From 2005, as GE\u2019s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and Senior Vice President/Director of GE Global Research, Mark reported to the CEO and developed fundamental technologies to help GE compete and grow in every one of its businesses: energy, oil & gas, aviation, healthcare, transportation, consumer products, and financial services. Mark\u2019s vision is now to help other organizations apply the lessons he\u2019s learned during his years of leadership at GE by working with business leaders and boards as an advisor and mentor.A company officer for 21 years, Mark had a two-part senior leadership career at GE managing both major lines of business and global research. Mark became only the ninth director of GE Global Research in the company\u2019s history. His team led transformative initiatives in software, advanced manufacturing and cybersecurity, and delivered countless innovations that produced GE\u2019s best product and service portfolio in years. Mark\u2019s research team of over 3,600 people was from every major scientific and engineering discipline, working at nine research facilities in the USA, India, China, Germany, Brazil, and Israel. As CTO, he led some 50,000 technologists across GE. These experiences gave him a profound appreciation for diverse cultures and working styles.His research group is currently developing OptoPill Assembly, the newest RM3 process, and using it to create optoelectronic integrated circuits for a variety of applications, including optical clock and signal distribution on silicon integrated circuits, diffuse optical tomography on living tissue, and parallel signal processing in optically coupled neural network arrays. The group is also concerned with the molecular beam epitaxy growth of III-V heterostructures and their application in a variety of advanced electronic and optoelectronic devices, including p-i-n photodiodes, quantum- well laser diodes, and microscale thermophotovoltaic cells. Shaffiq Jaffer is the Vice President of Corporate Science and Technology Projects for Total S.A. in North America, with the mission to find novel ideas and technologies across the research community: academia, government including defense research organizations and private research companies, that will lead to breakthroughs in energy (production, conservation, efficiency), materials (PV, Catalysts, biomaterials) and manufacturing processes.Clark Jernigan is the CEO of VUV Analytics, the leader in vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) absorption spectroscopy and has a successful track record in leading and developing early stage ventures, specializing in hardware, clean tech, and technology service companies. His 25+ year management career includes Venture Partner at Austin Ventures, VP/General Manager and Director of Engineering at Cirrus Logic, product development engineering and management at AMD, and equity research at Alex Brown. Sam Kogan is CEO of GEN5 Group. Dr. Kogan has more than 30 years of extensive experience in research & development and innovation. As company CEO Dr. Kogan plays a key role in leading the firm\u2019s strategy and operation. He also manages the company\u2019s biggest accounts, brings new ideas to existing markets, and opens new markets.Dr. Kogan is known as a thought leader and renowned speaker in the areas of Systematic Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Technology Developemnt. Dr. Kogan frequently speaks at leading innovation conferences around the world, with an emphasis on the Globalization of R&D, Emerging Markets and Technologies, Management of R&D and Innovation, Sustainability, Clean Energy, and Energy Storage topics. Before co-founding Gen5 Group, he was a CEO of GEN3 Partners and a COO and co-founder of Pragmatic Vision International where in addition to overseeing the firm\u2019s operations, he also helped develop client management strategies in the U.S., Europe and the Pacific Rim. Prior to Pragmatic Vision, he was the Director of Innovation Consulting Services at Invention Machine Corp. and held senior positions and led research programs within the R&D organizations at ICI and Plastpolymer Corp.Prior to that, Jos\u00e9 was a professor\u00a0in the Electrical, Computer and Systems Engineering Department of\u00a0Rensselear Polytechnic Institute (RPI) for 40 years where he taught and developed undergraduate courses in Semiconductor Electronic Devices, Solid State Electronics, Microwaves, CAD of Microwave Circuits and graduate courses in Physics of Semiconductor Materials, Properties of Compound Semiconductors and Solid-State Microwave Devices. While at RPI he published over 130 papers in refereed journals and gave over 95 conference presentations related to his research in the areas of radiation effects in microwave devices, RF non-destructive testing, solar cells and thermophotovoltaic cells with emphasis on device physics and device and material characterization. He was granted the title of Professor Emeritus in 1994.Paul\u2019s work with MTPV started at the earliest stage of the company\u2019s research and development when MTPV was still part of the Draper Laboratory. \u00a0Paul chose to continue his work with MTPV as one of its most accomplished staff members. \u00a0Rines founded and was president of the Academy of Applied Science, a nonprofit organization that conducts the National Junior Science and Humanities Symposia Program to encourage and reward high school scientific research, as well as the New Hampshire Young Inventors Program for primary schools. In 1994, Rines was inducted into the U.S. National Inventors Hall of Fame in recognition of his high-resolution image-scanning radar and sonar inventions, as well as the U.S. Army Signal Corps Wall of Fame. In 1995, the Robert H. Rines building was dedicated at the Franklin Pierce Law Center and in 1997, M.I.T. dedicated a distance-learning center in his name.", "Designing EnergyFor the Future", "His research group is currently developing OptoPill Assembly, the newest RM3 process, and using it to create optoelectronic integrated circuits for a variety of applications, including optical clock and signal distribution on silicon integrated circuits, diffuse optical tomography on living tissue, and parallel signal processing in optically coupled neural network arrays.
