"<html><head>\n<title>Stephen Senturia</title>\n</head>\n\n<body bgcolor=\"white\" text=\"black\">\n<h1>Stephen Senturia</h1>\n<p>Stephen D. Senturia joined the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer\n  Science immediately after completing his education (Harvard, B.A. in Physics,\n  summa cum laude, 1961, and MIT, Ph.D. in Physics, 1966), initially as Research\n  Scientist, then as Assistant Professor in 1967, with subsequent promotions\n  up the ranks. From 1992 to 2002, he held the Barton L. Weller Chair in Electrical\n  Engineering. He has been involved in microsensor and MEMS research since the\n  early 1970\u2019s. For a number of years, his research focused on developing\n  material-property measurement methods and CAD\n  tools for MEMS. The work on MEMCAD led to the spin-out from his group of\n  the two companies that lead this commercial field: <a href=\"http://www.intellisense.com\">IntelliSense</a>,\n  and <a href=\"http://www.coventor.com\">Coventor</a>. He was a co-founding Editor,\n  and later Senior Editor, of the ASME/IEEE Journal of Microelectromechanical\n  Systems, and he has been active in the leadership of the <a href=\"http://www.transducers03.org/\">IEEE\n  International Conference on Solid-State Sensors and Actuators</a>, serving\n  as Technical Program Chair in 1997 and as Local Arrangements Chair for the\n  2003 meeting in Boston. In 2000, he published <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/microsystem-design/www/\">Microsystem\n  Design</a>, a graduate textbook in MEMS modeling and design. Most recently,\n  he was part of the team developing the\n  Polychromator. After retiring from MIT in 2002, Dr. Senturia has served\n  as Chairman and Chief Technology Officer of <a href=\"http://www.polychromix.com\">Polychromix,\n  Inc.</a>, Wilmington, MA, a company he founded to adapt the Polychromator technology\n  for commercial use. Honor and professional societies include the National Academy\n  of Engineering, the IEEE (Fellow), Phi Beta Kappa, and Sigma Xi. In addition\n  to serving on several academic and industrial Advisory Boards, Dr. Senturia\n  is President of the Transducer Research Foundation, a non-profit organization\n  that sponsors conferences in the MEMS fields and uses the proceeds to support\n  student travel grants. </p>\n<h2>Address</h2>\n<address>\nStephen Senturia<br>\nMIT, Room 39-344C<br>\nCambridge, MA 02139<br>\nPhone: 617 253-6869<br>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:sds@mtl.mit.edu\">sds@mtl.mit.edu</a><br>\n<br>\nPreferred address for mail, phone, fax:<br>\n98 Crowninshield Road<br>\nBrookline, MA 02446<br>\nPhone: 617 731 3905<br>\nFax: 617 731 5165\n</address>\n<p> \n</p><hr>\n<address>\n</address>\n\n\n</body></html>"
