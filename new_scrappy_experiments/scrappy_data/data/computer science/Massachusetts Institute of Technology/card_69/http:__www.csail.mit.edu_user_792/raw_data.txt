In 2015, he received the ACM/IEEE A. Richard Newton Technical Impact award in Electronic Design Automation. He received the IEEE Computer Society Technical Achievement Award in 2014 for inventing Physical Unclonable Functions and single-chip secure processor architectures. Devadas's work on hardware information flow tracking published in the 2004 ASPLOS received the ASPLOS Most Influential Paper Award in 2014. His papers on analytical cache modeling and the Aegis single-chip secure processor were included as influential papers in \"25 Years of the International Conference on Supercomputing.\" In 2017 he received the IEEE W. Wallace McDowell Award for contributions to secure hardware. He is an IEEE and ACM Fellow."]}
