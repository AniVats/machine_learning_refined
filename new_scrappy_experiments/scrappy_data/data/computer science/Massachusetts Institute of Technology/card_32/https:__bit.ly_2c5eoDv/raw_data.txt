He joined MTL as a core member and is also a resident member in MTL with his office in building 39. He received his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. from Stanford University in Electrical Engineering. During his Ph.D., his research on carbon nanotube-based transistors and circuits resulted in the first digital systems built entirely using carbon nanotube FETs (including the first carbon nanotube microprocessor), the first monolithic three-dimensional integrated circuits combining arbitrary vertical stacking of logic and memory, and the highest performance and highly-scaled carbon nanotube transistors to-date.At MIT, Max is launching an experimental research program aimed at realizing his vision for the next-generation of electronic systems based on transformation nanosystems: leveraging the unique properties of emerging nanotechnologies and nanodevices to create new systems and architectures with enhanced functionality and improved performance. About this, he states: \"While investigating new devices or new architectures separately can be beneficial, combining the \"right\" devices, with the \"right\" architectures, in the \"right\" way, results in performance (e.g., speed, energy efficiency) gains which far exceed the sum of their individual benefits, while simultaneously providing a rich set of enhanced functionality for applications that otherwise may not be feasible using traditional technologies.\""]}
