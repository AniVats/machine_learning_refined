Using these multi-robot systems can offer more parallelism, adaptability, and fault tolerance when compared to a traditional single robot. I am also interested in investigating how new technologies will allow for more capable multi-robot systems, and how these technologies impact the design of multi-robot algorithms, especially as these systems begin to number in the hundreds, thousands, or even millions of robots.</span><br/>", "McCormick School of Engineering,\u00a0\n                        \n                        \n                        Northwestern University"]}
