Her research explores the design of novel computational systems to help learners develop motivation and effective practices in STEM domains. Recent projects include the design of situated feedback models to promote the growth mindset, studying how game mechanics encourage novices to practice effective problem-solving skills, and developing learner-centered web inspection tools that help novice web developers learn directly from professional websites. Her interventions have been used by over 100,000 students online, adopted by companies, and integrated into classrooms. She earned her Ph.D. in Computer Science &amp; Engineering at the University of Washington as a member of the Center for Game Science. Her work has been funded through three NSF grants totaling over $1.4 million, and has been recognized through best paper honorable mentions at UIST and CHI, as well as the Google Anita Borg Scholarship and the Microsoft Research Graduate Women's Scholarship.<br/>", "McCormick School of Engineering,\u00a0\n                        \n                        \n                        Northwestern University"]}
