He leads the Northwestern Networks Group. His research interests are in the area of computer networking with emphasis on design, measurements, analysis, denial-of-service resiliency, and prototype implementation of protocols and algorithms for the Internet. He is most well-known for his pioneering work on low-rate denial-of-service attacks, TCP congestion control, and data sharing methods for Internet-scale systems. He has published more than 60 research papers in the most prestigious networking journals and conferences such as IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, ACM SIGCOMM, USENIX NSDI, ACM SIGMETRICS, ACM IMC, IEEE ICNP, IEEE INFOCOM, etc. His systems and tools are widely distributed on the Internet. As an example, his TCP-LP protocol has been incorporated in the Linux operating system, his work on Explicit Congestion Notification has become an Internet standard, and his work on denial-of-service resiliency for Internet streaming infrastructures has been adopted by the world\u2019s largest content distribution network, Akamai.\nDr. Kuzmanovic joined the Northwestern faculty in 2005 after receiving a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Rice University, under the direction of Edward W. Knightly. He received B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering from the University of Belgrade (ETF), Serbia, in 1996 and 1999, respectively. From 1997-1999 he was a research scientist in the Mihajlo Pupin Institute. He received Rice University\u2019s Presidential Fellowship in 1999. Together with his colleagues, he received the Microsoft Trustworthy Computing Award in 2006. He was elected a Searle Junior Fellow in 2006, which recognizes young faculty who show excellence in teaching. He received the National Science Foundation CAREER Award in 2008. He has been appointed a Visiting Professor at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. He is a member of the steering committee of the Measurement Lab, a Google-initiated open platform for monitoring net neutrality. He was a member of the advisory board of Narus, Inc. 2008 \u2013 2014. He is a co-founder of Nanjee, Inc and bloXroute Labs, Inc.<br/>", "McCormick School of Engineering,\u00a0\n                        \n                        \n                        Northwestern University"]}
