Such designs are elusive due to technological limitations on yield, power, and memory bandwidth. My research aims to pave the way to energy-efficient computing by investigating ideas to combat dark silicon, and to speed up the execution of programs by several factors through parallelism extraction, memoization at the software and hardware levels, blending of compilers, operating systems and architectures, and the use of emerging technologies. Our work extends across multiple stacks: emerging devices (nanophotonics, quantum), circuit design, processor architecture, memory systems, interconnects, compilers, runtime environments, and system software.<br/>", "McCormick School of Engineering,\u00a0\n                        \n                        \n                        Northwestern University"]}
