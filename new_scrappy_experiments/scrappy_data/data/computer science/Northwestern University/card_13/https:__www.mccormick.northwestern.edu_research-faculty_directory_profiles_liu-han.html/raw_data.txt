He has been the director of the deep reinforcement learning center at Tencent AI Lab and had been a professor at the Princeton University and Johns Hopkins University. He received a joint PhD in Machine Learning and Statistics from the Machine Learning Department at the Carnegie Mellon University, advised by\u00a0John Lafferty\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Larry Wasserman</a>.\u00a0His research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and computer systems, which deploys\u00a0statistical machine learning methods on edges and clouds to achieve analytical advantages. Han Liu has received numerous research awards including the Alfred P Sloan Fellowship in Mathematics, the IMS Tweedie New Researcher Award, the ASA Noether Young Scholar Award, the NSF CAREER Award, the Howard B Wentz Award and the Umesh Gavaskar Memorial Best Dissertation Award. He is now serving as associate editors for the Journal of American Statistical Association, the Electronic Journal of Statistics, the Technometrics, and the Journal of Portfolio Management.<h2>Research Interests</h2>My primary research interest is modern artificial intelligence, which exploits computation and data as a lens to explore machine intelligence. To make progress, I examine this with the point of view provided by the twin windows of\u00a0statistical machine learning\u00a0and\u00a0computer systems. Statistical machine learning provides a unified framework which combines uncertainty and logical structure to model complex, real-world phenomena, while computer systems implement the learning algorithms with the highest performance guarantees. Together they provide a powerful tool to explore complex interactions among a large number of variables, which has important applications in modern sciences. Success on this research has the potential to revolutionarize the foundation of modern data science and push the frontier of artificial intelligence.", "McCormick School of Engineering,\u00a0\n                        \n                        \n                        Northwestern University"]}
