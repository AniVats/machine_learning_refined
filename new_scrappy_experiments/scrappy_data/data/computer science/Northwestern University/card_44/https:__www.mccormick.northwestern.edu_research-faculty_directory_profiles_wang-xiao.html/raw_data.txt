I'm currently <span>conducting a joint post-doctoral fellowship with Vinod Vaikuntanathan at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Ran Canetti at Boston University.</span> I was a Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, where I was advised by Professor Jonathan Katz. My research interests focus on applied cryptography, specifically on designing efficient privacy-preserving systems based on secure multi-party computation. For this work, I received a Best Paper Award in Applied Cyber Security at CSAW 2015, an iDASH Competition Award in 2015, a Human Longevity Inc. Award for MPC in 2016, and an ACM CCS Best Paper Award in 2017.<h2>Research Interests</h2><span>Computer security, privacy, and cryptography</span><br/><div style=\"clear: both;\">\u00a0\n<div id=\"back-to-top\"><a href=\"#top\">BACK TO TOP</a>", "McCormick School of Engineering,\u00a0\n                        \n                        \n                        Northwestern University"]}
