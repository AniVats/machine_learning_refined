I am interested in designing efficient algorithms for computationally hard problems. The aim of my research is to introduce new core techniques and design general principles for developing and analyzing algorithms that work in theory and practice. My research interests include approximation algorithms, beyond worst-case analysis, and applications of high-dimension geometry to computer science.\nBefore joining Northwestern University, I was a researcher at Microsoft and IBM Research Labs. I obtained my PhD in Computer Science from Princeton University in 2007.<h2>Research Interests</h2><span>The aim of my research is to introduce new core techniques and design general principles for developing and analyzing algorithms that work in theory and practice.
