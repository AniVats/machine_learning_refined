Houstis's current research interests\nare in the areas of problem solving environments (PSEs), parallel\ncomputation, performance evaluation and modeling, computational\nintelligence, computational finance, and on-line learning. He is\none of the principal designers of several domain specific PSEs\n(i.e., Parallel ELLPACK, PDELab) and numerous performance\nevaluation studies of PDE software and parallel architectures. He\nis leading the Parallel ELLPACK group, which is developing\ninfrastructure and implementing methodologies for reusing \"legacy\"\nPDE software on a variety of physical and virtual parallel machines\nand designing a Web Parallel ELLPACK server. Houstis has been\ninvolved in the designing of a knowledge based framework (known as\nPYTHIA) to support the selection of algorithm and machine pairs for\na given class of PDE problems based on performance knowledge. This\nframework has been applied to a simulation system for designing HPC\nsystems (POEMS project), a virtual laboratory environment, and\nrecommender system for mathematical software. He has published\nseveral books and over 120 technical articles. He has supervised 14\nPhD students and several MS students. His research has been\nsupported by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the Army\nResearch Office, DARPA, DOE, ESPRIT, INTEL, IBM, AT&T,\nKozo-Japan, Purdue University, National Science Foundation, and the\nGreek Research Foundation.\n", "Department of Computer Science, 305 N.
