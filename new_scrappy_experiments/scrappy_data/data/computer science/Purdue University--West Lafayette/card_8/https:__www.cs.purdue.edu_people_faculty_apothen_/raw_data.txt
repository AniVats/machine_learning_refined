CSC is  an\ninterdisciplinary research area where discrete mathematics\nand algorithms are applied to combinatorial problems from\nthe sciences and engineering. CSC links scientific\ncomputing with  algorithmic computer science.\nAlex Pothen, with his colleagues,  led the effort to organize the CSC research community in the early 2000's. He was Co-Chair of the first three international workshops in CSC, and serves as the Chair of the CSC Steering Committee.\nIn Bioinformatics, Alex is developing algorithms for registering and classifying cell populations in Flow Cytometry data to understand the immune system. He has also developed algorithms for identifying functional modules in protein interaction networks, and for identifying biomarkers for lung and prostate cancer from mass spectral data.\nAlex has mentored sixteen PhD students, six post-doctoral scientists, more than sixty Master's students, and several undergraduate researchers. His advisees hold (or have held) appointments at Washington State University, Penn State, Waterloo, Australian National University, and Drexel; Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and Conviva Corporation; and Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Lawrence Livermore National Lab, Pacific Northwest National Lab, Argonne National Lab, etc.  Alex served as the Director of the Combinatorial Scientific Computing and Petascale Simulations (CSCAPES) Institute, a pioneering research project in CSC funded by the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science from 2006-2012. The CSCAPES Institute involved thirty researchers from Purdue, Old Dominion University, Sandia National Labs, Argonne National Lab, Ohio State, and Colorado State. CSCAPES researchers developed computational tools in CSC that enable large-scale computational models in science and engineering on Peta-scale computers. These tools included parallelization and load-balancing software, Automatic Differentiation technology, parallel graph and sparse matrix algorithms, and transformations to improve the memory system performance of sparse computations.\n", "Department of Computer Science, 305 N.
