This includes\nprivacy-preserving data mining, data de-identification and\nanonymization, and limits on identifying individuals from\ndata mining models. He also works more broadly in data\nmining, including data mining of text and data mining\ntechniques applied to interoperation of heterogeneous\ninformation sources. Fundamental data mining challenges\nposed by these applications include extracting knowledge\nfrom noisy data, identifying knowledge in highly skewed\ndata (few examples of \"interesting\" behavior), and limits\non learning. He also works on database support for widely\ndistributed and autonomously controlled information,\nparticularly issues related to data privacy.\n", "Department of Computer Science, 305 N.
