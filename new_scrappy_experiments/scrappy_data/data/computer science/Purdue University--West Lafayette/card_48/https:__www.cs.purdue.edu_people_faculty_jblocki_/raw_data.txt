Are there easy ways for humans to create and remember multiple strong passwords? Can we design secure cryptographic protocols that are so simple that can be run by a human? Jeremiah has also developed algorithms for conducting privacy preserving data analysis in several different application settings including social networks and password data. Prior to joining Purdue Jeremiah completed his PhD on Usable Human Authentication at Carnegie Mellon University under the supervision of his advisors Manuel Blum and Anupam Datta. He also spent a year at Microsoft Research New England as a postdoc. ", "Department of Computer Science, 305 N. University Street, West Lafayette, IN 47907"]}
