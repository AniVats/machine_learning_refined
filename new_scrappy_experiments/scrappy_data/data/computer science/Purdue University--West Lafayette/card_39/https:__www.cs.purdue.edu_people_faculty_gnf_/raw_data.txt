His recent\nwork has focused on designing data structures to\ndynamically maintain information about graphs, on designing\noptimal algorithms for parametric search problems on trees,\nand on discovering graph decompositions that facilitate\nfast algorithms for shortest path problems. Professor\nFrederickson has served on the editorial boards of \n\tSIAM\nJournal on Computing\n\t, SIAM Journal on Discrete\nMathematics\n\t, and IEEE Transactions on\nComputers\n\t, and Algorithmica. He has published four books, Dissections Plane & Fancy,\nCambridge University Press, 1997, \n\tHinged Dissections:\nSwinging & Twisting\n\t, Cambridge University Press,\n2002, \n\tPiano-Hinged Dissections: Time to Fold!,\nA K Peters, 2006, and \n\tErnest Irving Freese's `Geometric Transformations': the Man, the Manuscript, the Magnificent Dissections!, World Scientific Publishing, 2017. Professor Frederickson was recognized in\n2003-04 as a Top Ten Outstanding Teacher in Science at\nPurdue, and was inducted into Purdue's Book of Great\nTeachers in 2008. He won a George Polya Award from\nthe Mathematical Association of America in 2004, and again\nin 2009.\n", "Department of Computer Science, 305 N. University Street, West Lafayette, IN 47907"]}
