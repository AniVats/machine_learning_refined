His current projects are robust computational\ngeometry,model acquisition for computer graphics, generalized\ncamera models, and robot path planning. He has also researched\nmechanical design algorithms using configuration spaces. The\nresearch led to practical design software for kinematic analysis,\nsimulation, tolerancing, and parametric design of mechanical\nsystems with higher pairs and changing contact topologies. The\nsoftware has been used at Ford Motors for transmission design and\nat Sandia National Laboratory for micro-mechanism design.\n", "Department of Computer Science, 305 N.
