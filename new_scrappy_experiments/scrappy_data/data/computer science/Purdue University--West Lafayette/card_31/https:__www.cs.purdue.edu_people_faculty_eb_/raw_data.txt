Bareinboim is broadly interested in artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, robotics, and the philosophy of science. His thesis work was the first to propose a general solution to the problem of \"data fusion,\"  and provides practical methods for combining datasets generated under different experimental conditions. Bareinboim recognitions include the AI's 10 to Watch (IEEE), the Dan David Prize Scholarship, the Yahoo! Key Scientific Challenges Award, and the 2014 AAAI Outstanding Paper Award.\n", "Department of Computer Science, 305 N. University Street, West Lafayette, IN 47907"]}
