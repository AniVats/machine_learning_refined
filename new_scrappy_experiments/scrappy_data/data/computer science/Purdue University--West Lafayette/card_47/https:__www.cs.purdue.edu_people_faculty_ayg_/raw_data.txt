His work on distributed infrastructure deals with development of software support for dynamic clustered and multiclustered environments. More recent work has focused on resource location and allocation mechanisms in peer-to-peer networks. His research on applications has focused on particle dynamics methods, their applications to dense linear system solvers, and fast algorithms for data compression and analysis.Mehmet Koyuturk, Yohan Kim, Shankar Subramaniam, Wojciech\nSzpankowski, and Ananth Grama, \"Detecting conserved interaction patterns in biological\nnetworks\", ", "Department of Computer Science, 305 N.
