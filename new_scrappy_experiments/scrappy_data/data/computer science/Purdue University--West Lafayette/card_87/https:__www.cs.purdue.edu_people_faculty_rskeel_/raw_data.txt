Such simulations are very demanding\ncomputationally, running for days, weeks, and even months\non parallel computers. Current research of Professor Skeel\nembraces three challenges: (1) the N-body problem for\ncalculating nonbonded interactions as well as dense matrix\n\"inversion\" for implicit solvent, (2) the problem of doing\ndynamics simulations on biological time scales, and (3) the\nproblem of calculating free energy differences and\ntransition paths in very high dimensional configuration\nspace. Professor Skeel has previously taught full time at\nthe University of Illinois where he initiated the\ndevelopment of the scalable parallel molecular dynamics\nprogram NAMD.", "Department of Computer Science, 305 N.
