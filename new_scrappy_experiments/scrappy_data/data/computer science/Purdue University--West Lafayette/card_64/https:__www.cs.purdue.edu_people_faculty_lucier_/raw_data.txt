The first paper is a study of radiologist\nperformance in interpreting wavelet-compressed mammographic\nimages. The compression method was designed specifically to\nkeep image features that are needed to interpret\nmammograms. The results showed that after compressing the\nimages over 50-to-1 (on average; compression rates ranged\nfrom 14-to-1 for mammograms with dense structures to over\n2000-to-1 for mammograms with few optical structures)\nradiologists interpreted the compressed mammograms ", "Department of Computer Science, 305 N.
