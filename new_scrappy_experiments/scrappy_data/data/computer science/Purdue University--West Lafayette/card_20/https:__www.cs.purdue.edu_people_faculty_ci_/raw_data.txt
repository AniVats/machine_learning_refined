Recent focus of his group in this area is on\nprogramming interfaces and compiler support for the\ndevelopment of innovative parallel software, targeting both\nlarge scale high-end systems and multicore microprocessor\nchips. In recent years, his group has also designed and\nimplemented compiler-based programming environments and\nrun-time systems for resource-constrained distributed\nsystems such as mobile devices, embedded systems and\nwireless sensor networks, improving their energy\nefficiency, reliability and maintainability.", "Department of Computer Science, 305 N.
