In\nrelational domains such as social network analysis,\ncitation analysis, epidemiology, fraud detection, and web\nanalytics, there is often limited information about any one\nentity in isolation, instead it is the connections among\nentities that are of crucial importance to pattern\ndiscovery. Relational data mining techniques move beyond\nthe conventional analysis of entities in isolation to\nanalyze networks of interconnected entities, exploiting the\nconnections among entities to improve both descriptive and\npredictive models. Professor Neville's research interests\nlie in the development and analysis of relational learning\nalgorithms and the application of those algorithms to\nreal-world tasks.", "Department of Computer Science, 305 N.
