He is the past chair of the Computing Research\nAssociation, a fellow of the AAAS, and the ACM, and he is a\nmember of the National Academy of Engineering. For 25\nyears, Professor Rice has analyzed numerical methods and\nproblem solving environments for scientific computing. He\nhas created a general methodology for performance\nevaluation of mathematical software and developed the\nELLPACK system for elliptic problems. It was extended to\nParallel ELLPACK and PDELab. Professor Rice has published\n30 books. Among these are: Solving Elliptic Problems with\nELLPACK (1985), Mathematical Aspects of Scientific Software\n(1988), Expert Systems for Scientific Computing (North\nHolland, 1992), Enabling Technologies for Computational\nScience (Kluwer, 2000). He has published about 300 journal\narticles and has 6 patents in computer security. The most\nrecent articles were in the areas of agent-based computing,\ncomputational science, computer security, mathematical\nsoftware, problem solving environments, scientific\nsimulation and web-based computing. In addition to the\nprojects appearing in the Research Funding section, he has\nreceived external funding for \"Effectiveness of Software\nProjection Methods\" (with Mike Atallah and Buster\nDunsmore), Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, 11/1/02 -\n11/1/03, $950,000; \"Automatically Protecting Software\nAgainst 'diff' Attacks\" (with Mike Atallah and David\nM'Raihi), SBIR Department of Defense, 8/12/03 - 1/31/04,\n$250,000; and \"Tools for Quantifying Software\nVulnerabilities and Protection\" (with Mike Atallah),\nIndiana 21st Century Fund, 4/1/04 - 4/1/05, $1,178,256.\nMost recently he has devised and patented methods to\nprevent the piracy of software and of digital data.", "Department of Computer Science, 305 N.
