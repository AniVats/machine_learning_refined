He has proposed the \"Saturation Effect\" as a motivating device, and as a fundamental principle, for the quantitative test assessment using an increasingly powerful suite of criteria. This device is often used by vendors to enhance marketing of their test tools. Mathur, in collaboration with Raymond DeCarlo, has pioneered research into the use of feedback control in software development. This research has led to the development of a new area now known as : Mathur, in collaboration with Luo Si's research group and IT specialist Jason Fish, is the prime architect of the INDURE expertise search system. This system is in use at four universities in the state of Indiana and serves as a model for expertise search systems under development in other states. : Mathur has led the establishment of one-of-a-kind set of testbeds to support research in the design of Critical Infrastructure including those for water treatment, water distribution, and electric power. These testbeds have served as a significant component in Mathur's work with his graduate students and research staff. This work has led to mechanisms for detecting process anomalies caused by cyber-physical attacks. These mechanisms have been successfully demonstrated on fully operational and realistic testbeds.Jonathan Goh, Sridhar Adepu, Khurum Nazir Junejo, and Aditya Mathur.
