Matrix algebra\nis a particularly attractive paradigm to study these\nprocedures as it often gives rise to efficient\ncomputational procedures in a variety of settings (serial,\nparallel, streaming). This research straddles a few\ndifferent areas and often involves working with large\ndatasets on high performance computing architectures (e.g.\nMPI clusters) and data computing architectures (e.g.\nMapReduce).", "Department of Computer Science, 305 N.
