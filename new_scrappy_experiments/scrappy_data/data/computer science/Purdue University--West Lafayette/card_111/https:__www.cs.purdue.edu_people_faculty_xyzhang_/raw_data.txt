In\nparticular, he has designed efficient and effective dynamic slicing\ntechniques which have a lot of applications in debugging runtime\nerrors, intrusion detection, and preventing software piracy. He has\ndesigned architectural support for protecting sensitive data in\nsymmetric shared memory processors. He has also conducted research\non program tracing and profiling, which includes novel\nrepresentations and creative compression techniques. Zhang is\ninterested in program analysis, both dynamic and static, and their\napplications in software engineering and security related issues.\n", "Department of Computer Science, 305 N.
