He has also\nbeen a visiting professor at the Christian-Albrechts\nUniversity in Kiel, West Germany (1980), and at Cornell\nUniversity (1984-1986). His research focuses on geometric\nand solid modeling, its applications to manufacturing and\nscience, and the simulation of physical systems. The\nresearch includes, in particular, research on geometric\nconstraint solving and the semantics of generative,\nfeature-based design. Professor Hoffmann is the author of\nGroup-Theoretic Algorithms and Graph Isomorphism,\nLecture Notes in Computer Science, 136,\nSpringer-Verlag and of Geometric and Solid Modeling: An\nIntroduction, published by Morgan Kaufmann, Inc.\nProfessor Hoffmann has received national media attention\nfor his work simulating the 9/11\nattacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center.", "Department of Computer Science, 305 N.
