Professor Bhargava is conducting research in security and privacy issues in distributed systems. This involves host authentication and key management, secure routing and dealing with malicious hosts, adaptability to attacks, and experimental studies. His recent work is on Intelligent Autonomous Systems and data analytics and machine learning. It includes cognitive autonomy, reflexivity, deep learning and knowledge discovery. His earlier work on Waxed Prune with MIT and NGC built a prototype for privacy preserving data dissemination in cross-domains. Based on his research in reliability, he is studying vulnerabilities in systems to assess threats to large organizations. He has developed techniques to avoid threats that can lead to operational failures. The research has direct impact on nuclear waste transport, bio-security, disaster management, and homeland security. These ideas and scientific principles are being applied to the building of secure networks and systems. ", "Department of Computer Science, 305 N. University Street, West Lafayette, IN 47907"]}
