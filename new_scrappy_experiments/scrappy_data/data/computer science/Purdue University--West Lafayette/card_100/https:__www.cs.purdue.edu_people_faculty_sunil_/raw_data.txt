His current research focuses on developing\nnovel database systems for managing probabilistic\n(uncertain) data, and ensuring authenticity and integrity\nof outsourced databases. In earlier work he has addressed\nperformance issues in large-scale, modern database\napplications such as multimedia, moving-object, and sensor\ndatabases. The efficient execution of I/O is a critical\nproblem for these applications. Dr. Prabhakar's interest\nalso lies in the design and development of digital rights\nmanagement for database using digital watermarking\ntechniques for structured (e.g. relational databases) and\nsemi-structured (e.g., XML) data. Prior to joining Purdue,\nDr. Prabhakar held a position with Tata Unisys Ltd. from\n1990 to 1994.", "Department of Computer Science, 305 N. University Street, West Lafayette, IN 47907"]}
