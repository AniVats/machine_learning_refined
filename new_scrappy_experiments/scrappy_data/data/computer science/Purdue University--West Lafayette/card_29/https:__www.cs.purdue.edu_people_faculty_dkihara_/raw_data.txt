In the last decade, a large amount of\nbiological data, such as genome/protein sequences, protein\n3D structures, and pathway data have become available. This\ndata now enables us to employ comprehensive analysis of\nrelationship between protein sequence, structure and\nfunction, interactions, evolution of protein families,\npathways, and organisms. Especially, he is focusing on\ndeveloping computational methods to predict and analyze\nprotein structure/function, protein-protein docking,\npathway structure, and their applications in genome-scale\nor pathway/network scale. He has worked recently on protein\nstructure prediction, protein global/local shape\ncomparison, development of prediction method of\ntransmembrane proteins, and its application to genome\nsequences.", "Department of Computer Science, 305 N.
