His group has developed a novel\n  architectural description language that facilitates rapid exploration of\n  programmable embedded systems, as well as automatic generation of software\n  toolkits supporting embedded systems development (including optimizing\n  compilers and simulators). Other projects within his group include\n  cross-layer design and optimization of reliable, distributed embedded\n  systems, memory architecture exploration for embedded systems, and\n  brain-inspired architectures and computing.
