He received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Stanford University, and his M.S. and B.S. in Computer Science from Tsinghua University, China, respectively.\u00a0 He was a recipient of an NSF CAREER award and several test-of-time publication awards, a part-time visiting research scientist at Google, PC co-chair of VLDB 2015, and an ACM distinguished member. Since January 2020, he\u2019s the treasurer and a board member of the VLDB Endowment.\u00a0 He was a co-founder and CTO of a startup to commercialize his research results.My research interests are in the field of data management, including data-intensive computing, query processing and optimization, visualization, and text analytics. My current focus is building open source systems for big data management and analytics.\u00a0My PhD thesis at Stanford was on data integration, with an emphasis on both theoretical and practical aspects. My recent research, especially after spending a few quarters at Google and a few years doing a startup as its founder and CTO, has a strong preference on engineering and open source system building. \u00a0I believe \u201cComputer Science\u201d is a \u201cScience\u201d to support great engineering, and we need to build systems to stay relevant in this fast-paced IT era. My recent research projects are closely related to social media data analytics due to its increasing importance in many disciplines. "]}
