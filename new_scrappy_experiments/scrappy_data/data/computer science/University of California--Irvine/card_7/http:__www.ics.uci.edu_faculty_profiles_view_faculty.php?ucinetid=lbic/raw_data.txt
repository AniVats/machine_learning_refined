A Messenger carries its own behavior as it propagates through a network of interpreter nodes. At each node, a Messenger can perform arbitrary computations, hence the collection of Messengers comprising an application may be viewed as a coordination layer, which triggers the execution of node-resident programs and carries data.<br/>"]}
