Previously at the CVPR <a href=\"https://scene-understanding.com/\">3D Scene Understanding</a> and <a href=\"https://sumochallenge.org/2019-sumo-workshop.html\">SUMO Challenge</a> workshops.\nA <a href=\"https://research.fb.com/announcing-the-winners-of-the-probability-and-programming-research-awards/\">Facebook Probability and Programming research award</a> supports work on scalable variational inference for probabilistic programs.\nOur cascaded 3D detection framework, which integrates geometric and contextual cues for robust scene understanding from RGB-D images, is summarized by a 2019 <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04725\">paper</a> appearing in <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8737746\">IEEE PAMI</a>.\nAn <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1816365\">NSF Robust Intelligence Award</a> with <a href=\"https://www.ics.uci.edu/~ihler/\">Alex Ihler</a> supports work on new particle-based algorithms for inference and learning with continuous graphical models.  I gave a <a href=\"slides/socalML17diverseMP.pdf\">talk</a> at the <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/socalml17/\">2017 SoCal Machine Learning Symposium</a> about our earlier <a href=\"papers/icml15dpmp.pdf\">diverse particle max-product</a> algorithm, which gives state-of-the-art predictions of continuous protein side-chain conformations.  <a href=\"http://people.csail.mit.edu/pachecoj/\">Code available</a>.\nAt <a href=\"http://www.aistats.org/schedule.html\">AISTATS 2018</a>, our framework for <a href=\"papers/aistats18semipc.pdf\">prediction-constrained training of probabilistic models</a> leads to improved semi-supervised learning of topic models, with applications to the analysis of documents and electronic health records.  This work received the <a href=\"https://socalnlp.github.io/symp18/\">SoCal NLP Symposium best paper award</a>.\nAn <a href=\"http://cs.brown.edu/news/2014/04/01/erik-sudderth-wins-nsf-career-award/\">NSF CAREER Award</a> supports our open source toolbox <a href=\"https://bnpy.readthedocs.io/\">BNPy: Bayesian Nonparametric clustering for Python</a>.  BNPy implements scalable, stochastic and memoized variational inference algorithms for a diverse range of Bayesian nonparametric models.\nWork with <a href=\"https://www.braingate.org/\">BrainGate</a> on <a href=\"papers/nips17mssmBCI.pdf\">multiscale semi-Markov dynamics for improved brain-computer interfaces</a> appeared at <a href=\"https://nips.cc/\">NIPS 2017</a>.
