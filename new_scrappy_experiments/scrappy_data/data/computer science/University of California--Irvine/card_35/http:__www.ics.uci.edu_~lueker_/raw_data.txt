Lueker is especially interested\nin applications of probability to problems in computer science,\nin particular\nthe analysis of the behavior of algorithms and optimization\nproblems when some assumption is made about the probability\ndistribution of inputs.  For example, he has investigated the behavior\nof the optimum solution to the bin-packing problem and the partition\nproblem.  With graduate\nstudent Mariko Molodowitch he developed a remarkably simple proof of\nthe result that the probabilistic behavior of double hashing is\nasymptotically equivalent to that of the theoretically ideal uniform\nhashing, for fixed load factors arbitrarily close to one.\nHe has also investigated improved bounds on the expected length of the longest\ncommon subsequence when the input strings are random.\n</ul>\n\n<hr/>\n</a><a name=\"research\">\n</a><a name=\"publications\"></a>"]}
