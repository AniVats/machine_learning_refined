Within the area of computational geometry, professor Dillencourt has investigated the structure of Delaunay triangulations and the closely related family of inscribable polyhedra. He has developed efficient algorithms for component-labeling and boundary extraction in binary images that are applicable to a variety of image-representation schemes.<br/>"]}
