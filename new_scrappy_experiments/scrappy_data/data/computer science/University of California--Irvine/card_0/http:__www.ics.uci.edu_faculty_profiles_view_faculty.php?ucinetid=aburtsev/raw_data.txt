At the\nmoment my research work is concentrated around three main themes: (1)\nnew operating systems: novel abstractions for structuring operating\nsystems, microkernels, virtualization, decomposed and library kernels,\napplication of safe languages to operating systems, security and formal\nverification of operating systems; (2) security and access control:\nobject capability access control, practical least authority for\nvirtualized environments and commodity operating systems, access control\nin datacenter, enterprise, and cloud networks; (3) operating system\nsupport for datacenter environments: operating systems for the whole\ndatacenter, low-latency system stacks for fast networking and storage\ninterfaces, novel virtualization solutions, fast inter-process\ncommunication, efficient support of non-uniform memory machines and\nemerging high-density non-volatile memory servers.<br/>"]}
