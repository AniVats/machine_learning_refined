RedLeaf brings together state-of-the-art results from verification,\n\t\tprogramming-language, and systems research communities in order to enable\n\t\tunprecedented security and reliability guarantees in low-level systems\n\t\tsoftware. To achieve complete verification of the entire software stack, i.e.,\n\t\toperating system and applications, the RedLeaf team will develop a set of new\n\t\ttools, a collection of techniques and engineering disciplines, and a\n\t\tmethodology focused on rapid development of verified systems software. The\n\t\tRedLeaf OS will run on an embedded CPU of a medical sensor, implement a network\n\t\tfunction virtualization framework aimed at line-rate network processing, and\n\t\tprovide a general platform for a broad range of verifiably secure systems. \n\n\n\t\tOther interests"]}
