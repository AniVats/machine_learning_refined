They provide massive parallelism, high computational capability and their behavior can be configured dynamically, thus making them a better alternative to ASICs and fine-grain FPGAs in many aspects. Mapping applications to such architectures is a complex task that is a combination of the traditional operation scheduling, operation to PE binding (or mapping), and routing problems. The focus of this research is to build a compiler framework which should be capable of mapping applications on reconfigurable architectures by taking into account different architecture and application parameters.\n  "]}
