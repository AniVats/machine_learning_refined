He created an early just-in-time compilation system, contributed to the theory and practice of continuous compilation and optimization, and co-invented the trace compilation technology that eventually became the JavaScript engine in Mozilla's Firefox browser.\nHis current\n                    research emphasis lies in the area of <strong>Software Systems</strong>, particularly focusing on compiler, virtual machine, and related system-level techniques for making software either <strong>safer</strong>, or <strong>faster</strong>, or <strong>both</strong>. Some of this research also falls under the labels <strong>Computer Security</strong>, <strong>Trustworthy Computing</strong>, and <strong>Software Engineering</strong>.\nDr. Franz has graduated 28 Ph.D. students as their primary advisor and has published more than 140 peer-reviewed research papers. He is the\n                      Principal Investigator on many competitive grants from\n                      the federal government, totaling  over $19M (of which more than $11M as sole PI), and has received more than a million dollars in unrestricted gifts from industry in appreciation of the research innovations he has contributed.\nFranz received a Dr.\n                    sc. techn. degree in Computer Science (advisor: <a href=\"http://www.inf.ethz.ch/%7Ewirth\">Niklaus\n                      Wirth</a>) and a Dipl. Informatik-Ing. ETH degree, both\n                    from the <a href=\"http://www.ethz.ch/index_EN\">Swiss Federal Institute\n                      of Technology, ETH Zurich</a>. He is a Fellow of the Americal Association for the Advancement of Science (<a href=\"https://www.aaas.org/\">AAAS</a>), a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (<a href=\"http://www.acm.org/\">ACM</a>), a Fellow of The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (<a href=\"http://www.ieee.org\">IEEE</a>), and an Inaugural Fellow of the International Federation for Information Processing  (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Federation_for_Information_Processing\">IFIP</a>).\n<a href=\"http://michaelfranz.com/cv.pdf\">(link to full CV)</a>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\">"]}
