Wythes and Marcia R. Wythes Professor in Computer Science, earned a doctorate from Yale in 1986 and joined Princeton the same year. His research interests involve distributed and parallel systems, operating systems, storage systems, and content-based search of feature-rich data. In 2001, he co-founded Data Domain Inc., a provider of deduplication storage systems\u00a0for efficient\u00a0backup and data replication for disaster recovery. The company\u00a0was acquired by EMC Corp. in 2009. Professor Li is an ACM fellow, IEEE fellow, a member of the National Academy of Engineering and\u00a0the Washington State Academy of Sciences. In 2012, he won the ACM SIGOPS Hall of Fame Award and the Distinguished Achievement Award from the Chinese Institute of Engineers.", "\n        \u00a9 2020 The Trustees of Princeton University.\n      "]}
