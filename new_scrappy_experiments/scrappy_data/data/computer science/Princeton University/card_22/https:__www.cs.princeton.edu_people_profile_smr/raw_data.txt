He investigates algorithms for processing geometry and reflectance, including registration, matching, completion, hierarchical decomposition, symmetry analysis, sampling, and depiction.\u00a0 Applications of this work include documentation of cultural heritage artifacts and sites, appearance and performance capture for digital humans, and illustrative depiction through line drawings and non-photorealistic shading models.", "\n        \u00a9 2020 The Trustees of Princeton University.\n      "]}
