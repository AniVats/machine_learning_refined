Guarantees like consistency\n\t    and transactional abilities make systems easier to reason\n\t    about and program against.  Performance properties like\n\t    latency and throughput affect end user experience and the\n\t    capital cost of systems.  We're exploring what\n\t    combinations of power and performance are and aren't\n\t    possible.  \n\t    Another of my research directions looks at understanding\n\t    and improving media processing, storage, and delivery at\n\t    massive scale.  \n\t    All of this research is made possible by my fantastic students:\n\t  "]}
