She is also Director of the Princeton\u2019s Keller Center for Innovation in Engineering Education, and an A. D. White Visiting Professor-at-Large at Cornell University. From August 2015 through March, 2017, Martonosi was a Jefferson Science Fellow within the U.S. Department of State.\nMartonosi's research interests are in computer architecture and mobile computing. Her work has included the widely-used Wattch power modeling tool and the Princeton ZebraNet mobile sensor network project for the design and real-world deployment of zebra tracking collars in Kenya. Her current research focuses on computer architecture and hardware-software interface issues in both classical and quantum computing systems.\nMartonosi is a Fellow of IEEE and ACM. Her papers have received numerous long-term impact awards including: 2015 ISCA Long-Term Influential Paper Award, 2017 ACM SIGMOBILE Test-of-Time Award, 2017 ACM SenSys Test-of-Time Paper award, and the 2018 (Inaugural) HPCA Test-of-Time Paper award. Other notable awards include the 2018 IEEE Computer Society Technical Achievement Award, 2010 Princeton University Graduate Mentoring Award, the 2013 NCWIT Undergraduate Research Mentoring Award, the 2013 Anita Borg Institute Technical Leadership Award, and the 2015 Marie Pistilli Women in EDA Achievement Award. In addition to many archival publications, Martonosi is an inventor on seven granted US patents, and has co-authored two technical reference books on power-aware computer architecture. Martonosi completed her Ph.D. at Stanford University.", "\n        \u00a9 2020 The Trustees of Princeton University.\n      "]}
