Baker Professor in Computer Science, in 1985 was the founding chair of the Department of Computer Science, a position he held until 1994. Before joining Princeton, he was a professor for 10 years at Brown University, where he earned bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in applied mathematics. He received his Ph.D. in computer science from Stanford in 1975. Professor Sedgewick\u2019s research interests revolve around algorithm design, including mathematical techniques for the analysis of algorithms. He has published widely in these areas and is the author of 16 books, including a well-known series of textbooks on algorithms that have sold more than one-half million copies and (with P. Flajolet) a research monograph on analytic combinatorics that defines the field. He has held visiting research positions at Xerox PARC in Palo Alto, CA; the Institute for Defense Analyses in Princeton; and Inria in Rocquencourt, France, and has been a member of the board of directors of Adobe Systems since 1990. He chairs steering committees that organize conferences on analytic combinatorics, analysis of algorithms, and data structures throughout the world.\u00a0With Kevin Wayne, he has developed four MOOCs (which have attracted over one million registrants) and extensive associated online content (which attracts millions of page visits per year).", "\n        \u00a9 2020 The Trustees of Princeton University.\n      "]}
