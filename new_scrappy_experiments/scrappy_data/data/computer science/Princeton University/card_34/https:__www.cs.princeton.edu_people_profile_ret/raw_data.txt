McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Computer Science, joined Princeton in 1985. He received doctoral and master\u2019s degrees in computer science from Stanford in 1972 and 1971, respectively, after earning a bachelor\u2019s in mathematics from Caltech. His academic experience involved assistant professorships at Cornell and Stanford, and a Miller research fellowship at UC, Berkeley. Professor Tarjan\u2019s extensive involvement in the private sector includes past and continuing fellowship, research and scientific roles at the NEC Research Institute, Princeton; InterTrust Technologies, Sunnyvale, CA; Compaq Computer, Houston, TX; Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA; and Microsoft, Mountain View, CA. His honors include Caltech\u2019s Distinguished Alumni Award in 2010, the 2009 Edelman Award from INFORMS (member of winning H-P team), fellow of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (2009), and the Blaise Pascal Medal in Mathematics and Computer Science from the European Academy of Sciences in 2004. Professor Tarjan was the first winner of the Rolf Nevanlinna Prize, established in 1982 and awarded every four years for outstanding contributions in mathematical aspects of information sciences by the International Mathematical Union.", "\n        \u00a9 2020 The Trustees of Princeton University.\n      "]}
