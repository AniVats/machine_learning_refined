She joined Princeton in 1999 as an assistant professor, became an associate professor in 2006 and was named a full professor in 2011.\nShe received her Ph.D. in computer science from MIT in 1996 after earning her master\u2019s and bachelor\u2019s degrees from Harvard. Her research interests involve developing and applying computational techniques to problems in molecular biology, with a focus on developing algorithms for genome-level analysis of protein structure and protein-protein interactions. She has been a member of the editorial board of the International Journal of Bioinformatics Research and Applications since 2004. Among her awards are the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) in 2001, and the Rheinstein Junior Faculty Award, from Princeton\u2019s School of Engineering and Applied Science in 2003.", "\n        \u00a9 2020 The Trustees of Princeton University.\n      "]}
