He leads the <a href=\"https://webtap.princeton.edu/\">Princeton Web Transparency and Accountability Project</a> to uncover how companies collect and use our personal information. Narayanan co-created a <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/cryptocurrency\">Massive Open Online Course</a> and\u00a0<a href=\"http://bitcoinbook.cs.princeton.edu/\">textbook</a> on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency technologies which has been used in over 150 courses worldwide. His recent work has shown how machine learning reflects cultural stereotypes, and his doctoral research showed the fundamental limits of de-identification.
