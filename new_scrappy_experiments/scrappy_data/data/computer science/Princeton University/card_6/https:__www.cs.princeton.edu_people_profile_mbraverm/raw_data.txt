He earned his Ph.D. in 2008 from Toronto and did post-doctoral research at Microsoft Research New England, Cambridge, MA. Professor Braverman\u2019s interests center on the connections between theoretical computer science and other disciplines, including information theory, mathematics, and economics. Most recently, he has been building new connections between information theory and complexity theory, studying the effects of noise in a variety of computational settings, and investigating how better algorithms can lead to better mechanism design, particularly in the context of healthcare.", "\n        \u00a9 2020 The Trustees of Princeton University.\n      "]}
