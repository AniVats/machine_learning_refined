Freedman is a Professor in the Computer Science Department at Princeton University, as well as the co-founder and CTO of Timescale, building an open-source time-series database. His work broadly focuses on distributed systems, storage systems, networking, and security.\nFreedman developed CoralCDN (a decentralized content distribution network serving millions of daily users) and Ethane (which formed the basis for the OpenFlow / software-defined networking architecture). He co-founded Illuminics Systems around IP geolocation and intelligence, which was acquired by Quova (now part of Neustar). Freedman is also a technical advisor to Blockstack, building a more decentralized Internet leveraging the blockchain.\nHonors include the ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award, ACM Fellow, Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE, given by President Obama), SIGCOMM Test of Time Award, Caspar Bowden Award for Privacy Enhancing Technologies, Sloan Fellowship, NSF CAREER Award, Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Award, DARPA Computer Science Study Group membership, and multiple award publications. Prior to joining Princeton in 2007, he received his Ph.D. in computer science from NYU's Courant Institute and his S.B. and M.Eng. degrees from MIT.", "\n        \u00a9 2020 The Trustees of Princeton University.\n      "]}
