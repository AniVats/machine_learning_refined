The two main strands\n      of work I have pursued involve bringing phased array signal\n      processing indoors and improving the capacity of \n      wireless networks in a world with many billions of wireless\n      devices, most of which transmit in wireless spectrum that is\n      unplanned by any central authority.\nFor further information, see the <a href=\"https://paws.cs.princeton.edu\">Princeton Advanced Wireless\n      Systems</a> (PAWS) group website."]}
