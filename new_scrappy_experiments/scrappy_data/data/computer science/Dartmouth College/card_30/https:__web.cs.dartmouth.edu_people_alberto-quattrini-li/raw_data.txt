The testing of our\u00a0algorithms focus directly upon real robots,\u00a0such as\u00a0ground robots and/or marine robots. The long-term goal is to design ubiquitous collaborative multirobot systems operating in real world environments to enable applications, such as environmental monitoring and mapping."]}
