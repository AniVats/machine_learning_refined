Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies brought us an avalanche of data: thousands of genomes and terabases of environmental DNA (metagenomes). I mine these data sets to assess the impact of horizontal gene transfer on microbial populations, find new ways to characterize microbial communities, and track down genomic signatures of microbial adaptations.\n <a class=\"btn\" href=\"http://carrot.mcb.uconn.edu/~olgazh/\">Personal Website</a>\n<div class=\"contact font14\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-person-email-address field-type-email field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"mailto:olga.zhaxybayeva@dartmouth.edu\">olga.zhaxybayeva@dartmouth.edu</a> <div class=\"field field-name-field-person-phone-number field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> 333 Life Sciences Center <div class=\"field field-name-field-person-hinman-box field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">HB 6044 \n<div class=\"field field-name-field-department\"><div class=\"field-label\">Department: Biological Sciences <div class=\"field field-name-field-education\"><div class=\"field-label\">Education: B.S. in Applied Mathematics, Kazakh State UniversityPh.D. in Genetics, University of ConnecticutPostdoctroal Training in Microbial Evolution, Dalhousie UniversityCertificate in Computer Graphics, Nova Scotia College of Art and Design </section>\n\n<div class=\"four column \">\n<aside class=\"bio-pic\">\n<div class=\"bio-person-expertise\">\n<img alt=\"Olga Zhaxybayeva\" height=\"405\" src=\"https://faculty-directory.dartmouth.edu/sites/dartmouth.edu.faculty-directory/files/styles/profile_image/public/olga.zhaxybayeva_0.jpeg?itok=Eifx27ME\" title=\"Olga Zhaxybayeva\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"323\"/> <div class=\"field field-name-field-expertise\">"]}
