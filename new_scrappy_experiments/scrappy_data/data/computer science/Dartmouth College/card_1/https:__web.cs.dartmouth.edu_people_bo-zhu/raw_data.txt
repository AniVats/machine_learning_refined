By combining numerical algorithms, applied mathematics, and 3D printing techniques, I investigate and develop physical systems that are fluidic, soft, multi-scale, mixed-dimensional, and computation-driven. In particular, I seek to create computer algorithms to unveil the connections between geometry, topology, material, and dynamics of these complex systems."]}
