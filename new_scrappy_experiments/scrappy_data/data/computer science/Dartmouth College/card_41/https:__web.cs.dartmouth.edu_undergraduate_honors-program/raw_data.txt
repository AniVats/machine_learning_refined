Honors students engage in independent work culminating in the writing of a senior thesis, and are considered for graduation with honors in the major. The experience of participating in an independent research project and of writing a senior thesis can be particularly important for anyone who intends to study for the Ph.D. degree in computer science. with a substantial independent component may also complete a written thesis based on that work. The subject of the thesis is often motivated by the content of an advanced course of the student's major, though a variety of activities can lead to a thesis. Student suggestions for theses are welcome. A student interested in pursuing thesis research should consult with his or her prospective adviser and get their approval for the thesis advising arrangement, along with the approval of the Departmental Undergraduate Advisor before enrolling in An abstract, which is a relatively short (1-4 paragraphs) summary of the main results of your thesis."]}
