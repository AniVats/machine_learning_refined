Most students who take COSC\u00a01 love it, and the course teaches programming (in Python) without assuming any prior background in CS. COSC\u00a01 is a good starting point regardless of whether you want to stop doing CS after just one class or you expect to take more CS classes. COSC\u00a01 is one of the prerequisite courses to the CS major/minor.We do not recommend skipping COSC\u00a010. However, if you took\u00a0a college course elsewhere that you believe is equivalent to COSC\u00a010 or if you believe you have a very strong background in object-oriented programming, data structures, and applying data structures to solve computational problems, you can request the Computer Science Undergraduate Program Director to\u00a0allow you\u00a0to place out of COSC 10. In this case, you will have to provide the relevant information\u2014when and where you took the relevant courses or gained the relevant knowledge, your grade, the syllabi, etc. The Computer Science department then determines whether to approve your request. in computer science. This choice enables you to pursue computer science broadly and deeply. Beyond the prerequisites, you will take\u00a0two courses each in the three main tracks of CS\u2014theory, systems, and applied computer science\u2014and three electives from among a wide selection of exciting courses offered in the department. You will culminate the major with a thesis or a project, which is again a choice you make based on your interests and career goals. You can find out more information at the , where you modify Computer Science with a different subject. If Computer Science is the primary subject of your modified major, you have an opportunity to learn CS broadly and deeply, although not to the extent of a full major. Specifically, beyond the prerequisites, you will take one course each in the three main tracks of CS\u2014theory, systems, and applications\u2014and three electives from among a wide selection of exciting courses offered in the department. You will culminate the modified major with a thesis or a project, which is again a choice you make based on your interests and career goals. On the other hand, if Computer Science is the secondary subject of your modified major, all that will be required are four electives, beyond the prerequisites. For any modified major involving Computer Science, the courses you select must form a coherent plan, and they must be approved by\u00a0the Computer Science Undergraduate Program Director.\u00a0You can find out more information at the "]}
