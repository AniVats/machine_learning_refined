A PhD is basically a research degree, which opens up a host of advanced and research-oriented opportunities.A PhD can be the ticket to jobs in academia, industry, and government, usually in some research or advanced development capacity, or in teaching at the college and graduate level. Or both teaching and research.Understand that a PhD is about one thing and one thing only: research. You'll probably be required to take classes and pass qualifying exams, but these are relatively unimportant. If you have a PhD, nobody should care what your graduate school grades were (and if they do, eye them with suspicion). And nobody will care how well you passed your qualifying exams. It will simply be assumed that you passed your courses and quals.\nWhat people will want to know about your PhD work is your research. What's it about? How good is it? How likely is it that you will be able to continue being productive in your area?Do you like inquiry, invention, creativity, exploration, reading, discussion, writing, thinking, teaching, discovering the unknown, etc? Do you like to work with others, or independently? (Both are big aspects of research.) Do you like to tackle unstructured problems, or would you rather work on a task assigned to you? Do you prefer thinking up new ideas and sketching out the basic fundamentals, or do you like to deal with finishing the details on a project?The PhD is basically a research degree. Note that scientific research today does not fit the \"lonely scientist\" or \"lonely hacker\" image, either at the graduate or professional level. Scientists--and computer scientists are scientists--do work with people. This is obviously true for teaching, but research is essentially a collaborative exercise. Meeting people and talking to people is a big part of research.Opportunities include academia, industry (research and/or development), and government (research labs).Postdoctoral appointments are becoming more common. In this case, after your PhD you go elsewhere for 1-2 years to do more research under a different advisor, in a different place, on a different project. Then you would go on to one of the above situations.Read their papers. Are you interested in their research?Visit the campus. Tour the facilities. Talk to grad students, especially those who work with someone you're considering as a potential adviser. Try to get a feel for the atmosphere, the morale. This is more important than you realize. Consider things such as office space, library support, computing facilities, special research labs or computers, etc. These are important when you try to do research. Try to talk to the relevant professors. Consider the locale, and the cost of living.Research assistantship (RA): You help a particular professor with their research, usually supported by a grant.Fellowship: This is the best. Usually this gives you all the money but with no teaching or research opportunities. Some schools do this for many of their first-year students, with the expectation that you will become a TA or RA in later years. A really good deal gives this to you for 3 or 4 or 5 years.\nThe essay is moderately important; in particular, it had better not be bad. The best essays somehow set you apart. Write your essay carefully, and rewrite it again and again. Tell them what research areas you are interested in, and why. Make it clear that you have a passion for research and would gladly charge through a machine-gun nest for the privilege of doing research. Tune the essay for each place you apply; tell them why you want to go there. Get the essay read over by someone else; make sure it is written really well. Sell yourself! Tell them what makes you unique. If you have written a research paper, or a major computer project, send them the paper (or documentation, if reasonable), perhaps after cleaning it up by making it even better."]}
