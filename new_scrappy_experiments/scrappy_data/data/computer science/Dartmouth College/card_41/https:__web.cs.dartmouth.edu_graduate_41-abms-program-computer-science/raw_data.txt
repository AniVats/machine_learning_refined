You may reduce the number of courses required for the M.S. degree by up to five courses, so that you can get an M.S. degree with as few as eight additional courses in the coursework track or as few as four additional courses in the thesis track. Each Computer Science course you take as an undergraduate that can count for graduate credit counts toward the limit of five. The eligible courses are those that are cross-listed as graduate courses (those numbered XX/1XX), as well as the courses available for graduate credit that are listed here. Dartmouth Computer Science majors who apply to the 4+1 program need not submit GRE scores."]}
