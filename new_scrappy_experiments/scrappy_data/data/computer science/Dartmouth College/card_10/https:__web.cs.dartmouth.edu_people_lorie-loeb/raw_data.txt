Information is everywhere, in large quantity and questionable quality\u2014monitors are\u00a0ubiquitous, over 100 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute, and the Internet\u00a0contains over 3.3 billion pages. People quickly shut down or ignore information when too much\u00a0is given, is hard to understand, or difficult to accept. My research focuses on effective methods\u00a0for presenting and visualizing information in order to get people\u2019s attention, communicate\u00a0effectively, and change behavior. "]}
