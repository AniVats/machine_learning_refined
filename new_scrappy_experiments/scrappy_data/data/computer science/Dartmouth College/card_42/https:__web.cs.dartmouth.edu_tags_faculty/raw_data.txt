Since its publication, the work has inspired a huge body of research and commercial endeavors that has continued to increase the breadth and depth of personal sensing. Some of the activity inference methods that are now common in smartphone operating systems can be traced back to the original CenceMe system.graduate researchThe ACM SIGMOBILE's RockStar award committee selected Zhou\u00a0\u201cin recognition of her outstanding early-career contributions and impact on our field: for multidisciplinary research examining unconventional wireless spectrum frequencies to build\u00a0next-generation wireless systems and\u00a0spearheading the field of \u2018visible light sensing,\u2019 which\u00a0turns the ubiquitous light around us into a powerful medium that integrates data\u00a0communication\u00a0and human behavioral sensing. The RockStar Award is our community\u2019s acknowledgement of the depth, impact, and\u00a0novelty of Xia\u2019s research,\u201d writes Edward Knightly, chair of the award committee.\u00a0"]}
