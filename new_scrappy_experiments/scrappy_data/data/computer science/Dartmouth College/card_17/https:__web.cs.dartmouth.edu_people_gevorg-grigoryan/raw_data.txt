I would like to understand how each protein's function is encoded in its molecular structure and amino-acid sequence. This is a highly interdisciplinary pursuit, involving concepts from biology, physics, mathematics, computer science, and chemistry. Understanding the language of proteins will lead to cures for human diseases and will teach us how to engineer smart novel materials.\n\n<div class=\"contact font14\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-person-email-address field-type-email field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"mailto:gevorg.grigoryan@dartmouth.edu\">gevorg.grigoryan@dartmouth.edu</a> <div class=\"field field-name-field-person-phone-number field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> Sudikoff 113 <div class=\"field field-name-field-person-hinman-box field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">HB 6211 \n<div class=\"field field-name-field-department\"><div class=\"field-label\">Department: Biological SciencesComputer Science <div class=\"field field-name-field-education\"><div class=\"field-label\">Education: B.S.
