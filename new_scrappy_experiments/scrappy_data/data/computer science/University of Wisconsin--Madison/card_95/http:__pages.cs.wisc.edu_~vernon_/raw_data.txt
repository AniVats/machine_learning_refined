Her modeling technique contributions\ninclude:\n(1) customized queueing-theoretic and other analytic techniques\nthat reflect the mechanics of the system and <em>accurately predict\nmeasured system performance</em> for various design options,\n(2) analytic bounds that quantify the opportunity for improvement as well as\nthe target system performance, and\n(3) customized analytic models that directly derive an optimal system design.\nShe has developed these techniques to address a much broader range of\nimportant commercially-relevant system design questions than were\npreviously known to be amenable to analytic modeling,\naccurately capturing the performance impacts\nof more complex and detailed system behavior than known\nto be possible with such abstract models.  Moreover, because the simplest\nanalytic model that predicts measured system performance readily yields\ninsight into <em>all</em> performance bottlenecks in a system design, \nher models have yielded powerful system design insights,\nincluding new, and in many cases near-optimal, designs\nthat significantly outperform previous solutions, for:\ncache coherence protocols, bus arbitration protocols,\nmulti-core/memory interconnection architectures,\nshared memory architectures for processors with aggressive\ninstruction-level parallelism,\nsystem synchronization primitives,\noperating system semaphore architectures, \nhigh-performance parallel job scheduling policies,\nstate-of-the-art high-performance parallel applications - including\nsparse matrix computations, particle transport codes,\nlarge-scale stochastic optimization and real-time ray tracing - \nrunning on state-of-the-art large-scale parallel architectures\nand computational grids,\nscalable video streaming protocols, \ndistribution networks for popular streaming content,\nInternet transport protocols,\ndifferentiated service Internet link scheduling policies, \nenterprise storage systems, and flexible manufacturing systems.\nA key observation from her body of work is that abstract analytic models\nthat predict measured system performance typically require 1/10th - 1/100th,\nor less, of the development time for accurate system simulators,\nand a key lesson is that the analytic results frequently uncover\nsignificant, previously unknown errors in a complex system (or simuator)\nimplementation.  This leads to the important new paradigm \nthat analytic models are also highly valuable for\nvalidating simulator and system implementations.\nAlong with her work on analytic modeling and quantitative system design,\nProf. Vernon has pioneered\nthe development of new, more precise and insightful \ncharacterizations of production high-performance parallel workloads,\nvideo server workloads, and network traffic,\nas well as\nthe development of key new insights into Internet security.\n\nDr. Vernon's contributions are documented in\ntwo U.S. patents for bus arbitration protocols, four U.S. patents\nfor scalable video streaming protocols and content delivery architectures,\nand over 100 technical papers, including seven award papers - most recently in\nSigcomm, Infocom, and the USENIX Security\nSymposium.  Her analytic techniques and\ndesign results have been reprinted in selective compilations for\nsystem architects, adopted in commercial systems and standards,\nand used by colleagues in academia as well as at many leading computing\ncompanies in the U.S. and overseas. Moreover, hundreds of students \nshe has taught, advised/mentored and collaborated with \nhave gone on to lead or guide major design teams at many of those\ncompanies or have joined the faculty at major research universities.  Her\ncontributions have also been recognized by\na 1985 NSF Presidential Young Investigator Award,\na 1995 NSF Faculty Award for Women in Science and Engineering,\nthe ACM Fellow award,\nthe UW-Madison Vilas Associate award, the UW-Madison Kellett Award,\nand the ACM SIGMETRICS Achievement Award,\nas well as invited Keynote talks at conferences in the U.S., Germany\nand Spain, Distinguished Lectures at universities and research\ninstitutes in the U.S., Canada and Germany, \nand numerous further invited talks throughout North America,\nEurope, Brazil and Japan.\n\nHer further leadership has included serving on \nthe editorial board of\nthe <i>IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems</i>,\nthe interdisciplinary 1993 NSF Blue Ribbon Panel for High Performance Computing,\nthe NSF CISE Advisory Board, the CRA Board of Directors,\nthe interdisciplinary Executive Committee of the National Computational\nScience Alliance (NCSA),\nthe NRC CSTB Committee on the Internet Under Crisis Conditions:\nLearning from the Impact of 9/11,\nnumerous program committees for top-tier annual conferences in\ncomputer system performance modeling and a wide range of computer, \ncommunication, and application design specializations, \nexternal review committees for various engineering colleges\nand computer science departments,\nand as Program Chair of the 1990 ACM SIGMETRICS Conference,\nProgram Co-Chair of the <em>Performance '96</em> conference,\nChair of the ACM SIGMETRICS Board of Directors, \nChair of the Computer Science Advisory Council at Princeton University,\nand as Chair of the UW-Madison Computer Sciences Department.\n\n<!-- ************End of Editable Region for Page Content ************************* -->\n\n</font></font></font></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n</td>\n<td width=\"1%\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://www.cs.wisc.edu/images/trans.gif\" width=\"20\"/></td>\n</tr>\n<tr valign=\"middle\">\n<td class=\"bgred\" height=\"20\" width=\"1%\">\u00a0</td>\n<td class=\"bg-vert-shadow\" valign=\"top\" width=\"1%\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://www.cs.wisc.edu/images/trans.gif\" width=\"20\"/></td>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"97%\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://www.cs.wisc.edu/images/trans.gif\" width=\"20\"/></td>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"1%\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://www.cs.wisc.edu/images/trans.gif\" width=\"20\"/></td>\n</tr>\n<tr valign=\"middle\">\n<td align=\"center\" class=\"bgblack\" colspan=\"4\" height=\"20\"> <font size=\"1\"><span class=\"bodywhite\">\n<!-- **************** Start of Editable Region for bottom navigation bar *********************** -->\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.wisc.edu \">Computer Sciences</a> \n\t| \n\t<a href=\"http://www.wisc.edu\">UW Home</a>\n<!-- ****************End of Editable Region for bottom navigation bar *************************** -->\n</span></font></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>", "\n\n\n\n\n     Feedback or content questions:\n     send email to \"vernon\" at the cs.wisc.edu server\n\n     Technical or accessibility issues: \n     lab@cs.wisc.edu\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2002, 2003 The Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System."]}
