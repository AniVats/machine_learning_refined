{"email": [], "image": [], "research_blurb": ["<ul>Since Fall 2013, I have been an Assistant Professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison in the Department of Statistics. I am also an affiliate for the Departments of Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Wisconsin Institute of Discovery Optimization Group. My research interests include statistical machine learning, optimization, graphical and network modeling and information theory with applications to systems biology and neuroscience. Prior to starting at UW, I completed a Masters of Engineering at University of Melbourne in 2008 under the joint supervison of <a href=\"https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/rtucker/\">Rodney S. Tucker</a> and <a href=\"http://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person4909\">Kerry Hinton</a>, and a PhD at UC Berkeley in 2012 under the joint supervision of <a href=\"http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wainwrig/\">Martin Wainwright</a> and <a href=\"https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~binyu/Site/Welcome.html\">Bin Yu</a>. I was also a post-doctoral fellow at SAMSI. My CV is attached <a href=\"CV/GarveshResumeFeb2016.pdf\">here</a>. \n</ul>\n<h2><b>Research</b></h2>\n\n\t\tMy research broadly focusses on challenges that arise in large-scale statistical inference problems.These challenges are espeically motivated by problems in systems biology and neuroscience. Existing methods for solving problems typically suffer from both statistical and computational limitations. I focus on developing methods that address these statistical and computational challenges which leads to: (1) novel algorithms and theoretical insights; (2) potentially novel insights in both systems biology and neuroscience.
