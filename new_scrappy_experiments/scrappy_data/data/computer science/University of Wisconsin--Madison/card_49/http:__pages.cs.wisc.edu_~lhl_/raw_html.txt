Landweber is the John P. Morgridge Professor Emeritus of\nComputer Science at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, where he was\non the faculty from 1967 to 2000 and served two terms as Chair. His\nresearch has been primarily in computer networks. He received his PhD,\nin Computer Science, from Purdue University.  In 1995, Newsweek Magazine\ncalled him the \"Guardian of the Internet\" and included him among their\n\"Net 50\" (http://www.newsweek.com/net-50-180208). He is a Fellow of the\nACM (1995) and in 2005 received the IEEE Award on International\nCommunication. In 2009, his CSNET project was awarded the Jonathan\nB. Postel Service Award by the Internet Society. He received an Honorary\nDoctor of Science from CUNY Brooklyn College in 2009. In 2012 he was\ninducted into the first class of the Internet Hall of Fame. In 2013 he\nwas honored as Distinguished Science Alumnus by Purdue University.\n</p><p>\nFrom 2003 to 2006 Dr. Landweber was Senior Advisor to the Assistant\nDirector for Computer and Information Science and Engineering of the US\nNSF where he consulted on strategic issues related to research funding,\ninter-agency coordination and organizational structure. He is currently\nan advisor to BBN/Raytheon on the NSF-funded GENI Project, whose goal is\nthe development of national and international scale network\ninfrastructure to support research on the network of the future.\n</p><p>\nHe has been a member of the Board of Internet2, Chair of its Network\nResearch Council and a member of its Governance and Nominations\nCouncil. He has been Chair of the Board, President and Vice President\nfor Education of the Internet Society and a member of the Boards of the\nComputer Research Association and the Public Interest Registry (.org).\n</p><p>\nEarly in his career, Dr. Landweber worked on the theory of computing,\nserving as Chair of the ACM Special Interest Group on Automata and\nComputability (SIGACT). His work in the 1960s on solving infinite\nregular games is the foundation on which much current work on temporal\nprogram synthesis, is based. Since 1977, he has worked on computer\nnetworks.  Dr. Landweber's first networking project in 1977, TheoryNet,\ninvolved an email system for theoretical computer scientists. In 1979,\nhe proposed the CSNET (Computer Science Network) project. The goal was a\nnetwork for all US university, industry and government computer research\ngroups. Funded by NSF in 1981, CSNET provided the first \"large-scale\"\ncommunity network based on Internet technology and was an important\nprecursor to the NSFNET. Landweber served as the first Chair of the\nproject and also co-led a project that designed and implemented an early\nnetwork-based directory system, \"the CSNET nameserver.\" By 1984, over\n180 university, industry, and government computer science departments\nwere participating. Concurrently, his team developed one of the first\nInternet protocol implementations (1981-84, IBM VM systems). Later, he\nworked with NSF on the development of the NSFNET, the first backbone for\nthe Internet.\n</p><p>\nDr. Landweber was a leader in the development of the international\nInternet. In the 1980s he helped establish the first network gateways\nbetween the US and countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America and also\nadvised these countries on the development of their national\nnetworks. Much of this progress resulted from a series of International\nAcademic NetWorkshops that he organized beginning in 1982. These were\nattended by individuals who were pioneering the development of national\nnetworks in their countries. The goals were to educate, share\nexperiences and encourage those attending to connect their countries to\nthe Internet.  These workshops accelerated the development of the\nInternet in many countries. Based on the success of the IANWs, he\norganized the Internet Society's first global INET conferences. In\naddition, his connectivity maps were widely used to chronicle the\nworldwide spread of the Internet (http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~lhl/maps/).\n</p><p>\nFrom 1987 to 1992, he led the Wisconsin component of the NSF-DARPA\nGigabit Testbed Project This research project accelerated the commercial\ndevelopment of fiber-optic gigabit speed networks. Until 2008, he\nparticipated in the NSF-funded 100x100 project, whose goal was to\nredesign the Internet to accommodate 100 million homes connected at 100\nMbps.  In the 1990s he helped initiate the Internet Society's Workshops\nfor Developing Countries. These workshops were a key factor in the\nspread of the Internet to developing countries. Later he collaborated on\nthe plan for what became the USAID Leland Initiative, the program that\nplayed a major role in bringing the Internet to Africa. While President\nof the Internet Society, he initiated the ISOC proposal to revise the\ngovernance of the Domain Name System and assisted in the formation of\nICANN.  He has been a member of the CCIRN, the Coordinating Committee on\nIntercontinental Research Networks, the Office of Technology Assessment\nAdvisory Panel on Information Technology and Research, three NSF\ndivision scientific advisory committees, and National Research Council\ncommittees on Computer-Computer Communication Protocols, The Future of\nthe NREN, and Information Technology Strategy for the Library of\nCongress.  \n</p><p>\nSince the 1980s Dr. Landweber has worked with a variety of for-profit\nand non-profit companies both as a consultant and as a member of their\nBoards of Directors. In the 1990s he co-founded an angel investment\ngroup in Madison, WI that focused on information technology.\n</p>\n</body></html>"
