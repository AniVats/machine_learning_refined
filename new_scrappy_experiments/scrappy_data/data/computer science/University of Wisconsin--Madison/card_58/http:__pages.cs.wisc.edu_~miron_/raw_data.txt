My group is engaged in research\nefforts to develop management and scheduling techniques that empower high\nthroughput computing on local and wide area clusters of distributively owned\nresources. The results of these efforts are translated into production code and\nare incorporated into the Condor system.  Condor is a widely used high\nthroughput computing system. The worldwide user community of Condor plays an\nimportant and active role in our research.  Researchers from a wide spectrum of\nscientific disciplines collaborate with us in the development and evaluation of\nCondor.\n\nIn the area of visual exploration of information my group works on developing a\nframework and tools for intuitive graphical interaction with collections of\nmultimedia data. Our framework is based on a declarative approach to the\ncreation of active visual presentations of tabular data.  We implement our\ntools in Java and work closely with domain scientists on testing and evaluating\nthem with real data. Some of this data is stored in scientific databases that\nare connected to real-time and off-line data sources.", "\n"]}
