Our methods merge elements of both direct and iterative solvers to reduce the storage footprint and \nmemory-bound nature of traditional solution techniques while leveraging opportunities for SIMD and thread-based parallelism. \n\nI am also working on developing numerically robust algorithms for cutting tetrahedral meshes. Our method uses geometric predicates \nthat operate on pristine input coordinates in a manner that minimizes the depth of the algebraic tree and integrates adaptive \narithmetic for any computation that requires additional precision.<br/><br/>\n\nAs a chemist my research investigated charge transport through self-assembled monolayers of conjugated organic molecules, nanoelectrode fabrication and characterization, \nsol-gel synthesis of porous metal oxides aerogels and electrochemical characterization of proton conductivity within these structures, holographic film synthesis, and the\nfundamental magnetic properties of electron transport through electrochemically fabricated segmented nickel-bismuth-nickel nanowires.\n</h4>\n<br/>\n<hr/>"]}
