These problems have intrinsic mathematical interest,\nas well as applications to random number generation, codes for\nreliable and secure information transmission, computer algebra,\nand other areas. <p>\n\nI am also interested in applying probability theory to the design\nand analysis of algorithms. For example, if a large number is\ncomposite, it can be proved so by a simple test that uses an auxiliary\nnumber, called a `witness.' In practice one usually finds a witness\nby direct search among the small primes. This leads to the following\nnatural question. How large is the least witness, as a function\nof the number tested?  In recent work, we have given an accurate\nheuristic model, based on probabilistic assumptions, that allows\nthis, and similar questions, to be answered. </p><p>\n\n</p><h2> Some Recent Papers:\n</h2>\n\nComputing prime harmonic sums\n(with J.
