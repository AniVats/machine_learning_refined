Hill (http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~markhill) is \nJohn P. Morgridge Professor and\nGene M. Amdahl Professor of Computer Sciences\nat the University of Wisconsin-Madison,\nwhere he also has a courtesy appointment in Electrical and Computer Engineering.\nHis research interests include parallel-computer system design,\nmemory system design, and computer simulation. \nHill's work is highly collaborative with over 160 co-authors\nand especially his long-time colleague David A. Wood.\nHe received the 2019 Eckert-Mauchly Award and is a fellow of IEEE and the ACM. \nHe serves as Chair of the Computer Community Consortium (2018-20) and\nserved as Wisconsin Computer Sciences Department Chair 2014-2017.\nHill has a PhD in computer science from the University of California, Berkeley. \n\n\nDr. Hill's research targets computer design and evaluation.\nHe has made contributions to parallel computer system design\n(e.g., memory consistency models and cache coherence),\nmemory system design (caches and translation buffers),\ncomputer simulation (parallel systems and memory systems),\nsoftware (e.g., page tables and cache-conscious optimizations),\ndeterministic replay and transactional memory. \nFor example, he is the inventor of the widely-used ", "\n\n\n\n\n     Page last modified:\n     Sunday, 24-Nov-2019 19:51:04 CST \n     Feedback or content questions:\n     send email to\n     \n\n     Technical or accessibility issues: \n     lab@cs.wisc.edu\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2002, 2003 The Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System."]}
