One of the research thrusts involves developing communication support for sustaining end-to-end gigabit throughputs to mobile hosts in future Internet. Another thrust involves developing sensing and communication algorithms in millimeter wave networks. In additional to developing the necessary theoretical algorithms, research also involves implementing and experimenting with these algorithms on network testbeds.", "You can support The College of Engineering by making a gift to the University of Wisconsin Foundation."]}
