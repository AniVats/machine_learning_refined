Technology constraints of unreliable hardware, process variations, and energy efficiency are going to define computation substrates of the future. My research goal is to understand the constraints of the underlying technology and applications and use these to derive architecture and microarchitecture solutions. <a class=\"urllink\" href=\"http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vertical\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vertical Research Group Page</a>.\n\n<p class=\"vspace\"><a id=\"students\" name=\"students\"></a>"]}
