I am especially interested in\n  researching how to optimize future parallel systems, especially heterogeneous\n  systems.\n\n  Previously, I was a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at the\n  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where my thesis was selected as \n  the 2018 David J. Kuck Outstanding PhD Thesis Award winner.  As a graduate\n  student, my research focused on building efficient memory\n  hierarchies for tightly coupled heterogeneous systems, especially for emerging\n  applications like graph analytics applications and applications with\n  fine-grained synchronization.  My work improves performance and energy\n  efficiency for these applications by designing more efficient coherence\n  protocols, consistency models, and memory organizations.  Two of my papers on\n  this topic were recognized as IEEE Micro Top Picks Honorable Mentions.  I\n  also received several fellowships and awards for my work, including the\n  2018 ", "\n\n\n\n\n\t\tFeedback or content questions:\n\t\tsend email to\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t Technical or accessibility issues: \n\t\t\t lab@cs.wisc.edu\n\n\n\t\t\t Copyright \u00a9 2002, 2003 The Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System.\n\t  "]}
