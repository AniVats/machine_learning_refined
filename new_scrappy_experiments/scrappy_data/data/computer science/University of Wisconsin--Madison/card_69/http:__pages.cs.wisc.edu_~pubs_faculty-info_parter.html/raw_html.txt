Classical\niterative methods and most multigrid methods only work effectively\nwhen the system is positive definite. These methods can also be\nmade effective when the real or symmetric part of the operator\nis positive definite. On the other hand, in the indefinite case\ndirect methods which attempt to preserve the `sparseness' of the\nsystem may encounter (very) small `pivots.' Thus, this is a challenging\nproblem which effectively mixes concepts and procedures from linear\nalgebra and elliptic partial differential equations. I am now\ninvolved in several projects which attack this class of problems.\nThese include preconditioning studies and research on special\nmultigrid methods. <p>\n\n</p><h2> Sample Recent Publications </h2>\n\nPreconditioning Chebyshev collaction discretization for elliptic\npartial differential equations, to appear in <em>SIAM Journal\non Numerical Analysis</em>. <p>\n \nPreconditioning and boundary conditions without H(2) estimates:\nL(2) condition numbers and the distribution of the singular values,\n<em>SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis</em>, vol. 30, pp. 343-376,\n1993. </p><p>\n \nPreconditioning second-order elliptic operators: Condition numbers\nand the distribution of the singular values, <em>Journal of Scientific\nComputing</em>, vol. 6, pp. 129-157, 1991. </p><p>\n \n</p><hr>\n<address>\n This page was automatically created December 3, 1996.<br>\n Email <a href=\"mailto:pubs@cs.wisc.edu\">pubs@cs.wisc.edu</a>\nto report errors.\n</address>\n<hr>\n\n\n\n</body></html>"
