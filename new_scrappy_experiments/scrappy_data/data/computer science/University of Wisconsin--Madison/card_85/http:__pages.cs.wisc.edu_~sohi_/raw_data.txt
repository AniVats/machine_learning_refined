He has co-authored\nseveral papers and patents that have influenced both researchers and commercial microprocessors.\nIn the mid 1980s, while most computer architects were investigating in-order processors,\nhe investigated out-of-order processors. His paper \"Instruction Issue Logic for High-Performance,\nInterruptible Pipelined Processors\" (in ISCA 1987) articulated a model for a dynamically-scheduled\nprocessor supporting precise exceptions, a model that was widely adopted by several microprocessor\nmanufacturers. (This paper, and the journal version in IEEE Trans. on Computers, March 1990, have\nbeen referenced by over 150 U.S. patents.\n\n)\nHis paper \"High Bandwidth Data Memory Systems for\nSuperscalar Processors\" (in ASPLOS 1991) argued for non-blocking (or lockup-free) caches,\nand was instrumental in influencing high-end microprocessors to switch from blocking to\nnon-blocking caches. In the early 1990s while other computer architects started investigating\nout-of-order processors he proposed the concept of multiscalar processors and thread-level speculation\nin his papers \"The Expandable Split Window Paradigm for Exploiting Fine-Grain Parallelism\" (in ISCA 1992)\nand \"Multiscalar Processors\" (in ISCA 1995). Thread-level speculation and its variants are currently one of\nthe most active areas of research in computer architecture. His paper \"Dynamic Speculation and Synchronization\nof Data Dependences\" (in ISCA 1997) introduced the idea of memory dependence prediction, an idea that was\nused in the Alpha processor designs and is being considered by others.  His paper \"Dynamic Instruction Reuse\"\n(in ISCA 1997) proposed the concept of instruction reuse, another area of active research.  He and his\nstudents also had the first academic proposal for trace caches.  Sohi's research group also developed the\nSimplescalar simulator, a simulation toolset that is widely used for research and instruction.\n\n\nSohi has interacted heavily with industry.  Over the years he has discussed his research with architects\nand given talks in design groups at most of the leading microprocessor manufacturers, including\nDigital Equipment, HaL, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, MIPS, Motorola, Silicon Graphics, and Sun Microsystems.\n\n\nSohi has graduated 18 Ph.D students, many of whom currently hold academic positions at leading research\nuniversities (Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Purdue, and Toronto). They include six winners\nof NSF CAREER awards and a winner of a Sloan Research Fellowship. He continues to lead a research\ngroup investigating different models for speculative multithreading, approximate programs,\nvalue communication prediction, chip multiprocessing, and other innovations for future microprocessors.\n\n", "\n\n\n\n\n     Page last modified:\n     Monday, 13-Sep-2010 11:07:33 CDT \n     Feedback or content questions:\n     send email to \"sohi\" at the cs.wisc.edu server.\n\n     Technical or accessibility issues: \n     lab@cs.wisc.edu\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2002, 2003 The Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System."]}
