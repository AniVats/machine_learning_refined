My research spans broadly across topics in computer architecture and systems. My specific interests lie in new paradigms such as approximate, stochastic and intermittent computing for energy-harvesting IoT devices as well as traditional architectures, ranging from microarchitectural topics (e.g., branch prediction, value prediction) to cache hierarchies and networks-on-chip for many-core processors.\n. During this time, I fostered numerous academic and industry collaborations, including my work on the Anytime Automaton Model with the exploratory systems architecture group at IBM T. J. Watson in 2015. My research has garnered several paper awards and two IEEE Micro Top Picks citations in 2016 and 2017 (honorable mention) for my contributions to branch prediction and approximate computing. My PhD dissertation was nominated by the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering for the Governor General's Gold Medal, the CGS/ProQuest Distinguished Dissertation Award and the ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award in 2018. In 2012, I received a BASc in Engineering Science with Honours (major in Electrical and Computer Engineering) at the University of Toronto.\n", "<div class=\"line\">\n<hr/>\n\n\n<div class=\"owl-carousel owl-theme row\" id=\"team\" style=\"opacity: 1; display: block;\">\n<div class=\"owl-wrapper-outer autoHeight\" style=\"height: 319px;\"><div class=\"owl-wrapper\" style=\"width: 4320px; left: 0px; display: block;\"><div class=\"owl-item\" style=\"width: 360px;\"><div class=\"item\">\n<div class=\"thumbnail\">\n<img alt=\"...\" class=\"img-circle team-img\" src=\"img/iot.png\"/>\n<div class=\"caption\">", "\nCAP'NN: Class-Aware Personalized Neural Network Inference\n    Maedeh Hemmat, Joshua San Miguel and Azadeh Davoodi\n    ACM/ESDA/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC), July 2020\n[Paper]\n", "If you're interested in joining our research group, send Prof. Joshua San Miguel an email with your CV.", "\n", "TEMPLATE: ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
