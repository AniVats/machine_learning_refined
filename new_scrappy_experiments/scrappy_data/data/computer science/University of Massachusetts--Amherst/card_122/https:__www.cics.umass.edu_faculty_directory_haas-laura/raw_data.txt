She is best known for her work on the Starburst query processor, from which IBM's DB2 LUW extended relational database system was developed; on Garlic, a federated system allowing easy integration of heterogeneous data sources; and on Clio, the first semi-automatic tool for heterogeneous schema mapping.\u00a0 Most recently, she founded IBM Research's Accelerated Discovery Lab, a unique environment dedicated to (1) enabling research in and improvements to the tools and systems that facilitate analysis of data, and (2) enabling the business person or domain expert to focus on their investigation instead of the systems and data challenges.Prior to joining UMass, Dr. Haas spent 36 years at IBM, where she was rose to the level of IBM Fellow.\u00a0 Within IBM, she most recently served as Director of the Accelerated Discovery Lab (2011-2017); she was Director of Computer Science at IBM's Almaden research center from 2005 to 2011, and had worldwide responsibility for IBM Research's exploratory science program from 2009 through 2013.\u00a0 From 2001-2005, she led the Information Integration Solutions architecture and development teams in IBM's Software Group.\u00a0 Before that, Dr. Haas was a research staff member and manager at IBM Research - Almaden.\u00a0 She spent a sabbatical year at University of Wisconsin, Madison in 1992-3, and a shorter sabbatical at ETH Zurich in 2009.\u00a0 A.B., Harvard, 1978; PhD, University of Texas Austin, 1981.", "College of Information and Computer Sciences  | 140 Governors Dr., Amherst, MA 01003 | (413) 545-2744 | info@cics.umass.edu"]}
