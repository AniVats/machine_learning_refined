Her work offers crucial insights into data quality issues, through frameworks that diagnose the causes of errors and identify repairs in the processes that produce the data. Her research promotes users' trust in both data and systems through support for understanding and explanations. An overarching goal of her work is to augment data management with user-facing functionality that helps people make sense of their data and use it effectively.Ph.D., Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley (2009); M.S., Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley (2005); B.S., Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens (2003). Professor Meliou joined the College of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2012. Prior to this, she spent three years as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Washington.Professor Meliou has received recognitions for research, teaching, and service, including a CACM Research Highlight, an ACM SIGMOD Research Highlight Award, an ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award, an NSF CAREER Award, a Google Faculty Research Award, multiple Distinguished Reviewer Awards, and a Lilly Fellowship for Teaching Excellence. \u00a0Professor Meliou regularly serves on the organizing and program committees of premier venues in data management research. \u00a0In addition to her research, she is passionate about teaching, and about promoting the recruitment and retainment of women and other underrepresented groups in computer science.", "College of Information and Computer Sciences  | 140 Governors Dr., Amherst, MA 01003 | (413) 545-2744 | info@cics.umass.edu"]}
