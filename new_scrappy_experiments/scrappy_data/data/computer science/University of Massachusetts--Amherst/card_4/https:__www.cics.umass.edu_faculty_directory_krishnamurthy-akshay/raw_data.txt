He is most interested in design and analysis of interactive learning algorithms that judiciously acquire data in a feedback-driven manner. His work on interactive learning has spanned both unsupervised methods for exploratory data analysis and supervised methods for complex prediction problems. He has also worked on a number of other areas within machine learning including nonparametric statistics, anomaly detection, compressive sensing, and online learning.", "College of Information and Computer Sciences  | 140 Governors Dr., Amherst, MA 01003 | (413) 545-2744 | info@cics.umass.edu"]}
