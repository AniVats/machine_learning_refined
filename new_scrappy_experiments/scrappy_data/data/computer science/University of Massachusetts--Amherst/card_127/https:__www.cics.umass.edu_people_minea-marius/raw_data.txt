He applies techniques grounded in formal methods to analyze the correctness and security of software systems, including protocols, web applications and services. He has worked on formally modeling security properties and attacks, extracting abstract verifiable models from programs, and is particularly interested in detecting program errors and vulnerabilities.Marius Minea received his Diploma-Engineer (Honors) title in Computer Science and Engineering in 1993 from the Faculty of Automation and Computers, Technical University of Timisoara, Romania. In 1995 he received his M.S. and in 1999 his Ph.D. in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. In 2000-2001 he was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. Since 2002 he has been Associate Professor in the Department of Computer and Software Engineering at the Politehnica University of Timisoara, Romania. He is joining UMass in September 2018.", "College of Information and Computer Sciences  | 140 Governors Dr., Amherst, MA 01003 | (413) 545-2744 | info@cics.umass.edu"]}
