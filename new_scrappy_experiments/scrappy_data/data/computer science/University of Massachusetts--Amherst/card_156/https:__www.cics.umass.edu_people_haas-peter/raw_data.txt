Other projects focus on techniques for modeling, simulation, design, and control of complex systems, especially discrete-event stochastic systems, as well as onthe interface of simulation and information management.\u00a0, Engineering and Applied Physics, Harvard University (1978). Prior to joining UMass, Professor Haas spent 30 years at IBM Research, most recently in the role of Principal Research Staff Member. For the past 20 years he has also been a Consulting Professor in the Department of Management Science and Engineering at Stanford University, teaching and pursuing research on simulation of discrete-event stochastic systems. During 1992-93, he was an Honorary Fellow at the Center for the Mathematical Sciences at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and has also been an Assistant Professor of Decision and Information Sciences at Santa Clara University (1985-87) and a Staff Scientist at Radian Corporation (1979-81).", "College of Information and Computer Sciences  | 140 Governors Dr., Amherst, MA 01003 | (413) 545-2744 | info@cics.umass.edu"]}
