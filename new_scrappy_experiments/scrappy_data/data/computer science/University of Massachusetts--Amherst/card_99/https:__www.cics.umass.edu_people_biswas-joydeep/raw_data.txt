In support of this goal, I am interested in research in perception, planning, and control applied to autonomous mobile robots. My research in perception involves developing \u00a0to build and perform inference based on such models. My interests in planning include motion planning, multi-robot coordination, and task-based planning in domains including service mobile robots, and robot soccer.Professor Biswas' research on autonomous service mobile robots and robot soccer has been covered by several media and news articles. As a PhD student he was the recipient of the 2015 Siebel Scholarship. He has served on the Program Committee for the RoboCup Symposium, and continues to serve on the Executive Committee of the RoboCup Small Size League.", "College of Information and Computer Sciences  | 140 Governors Dr., Amherst, MA 01003 | (413) 545-2744 | info@cics.umass.edu"]}
