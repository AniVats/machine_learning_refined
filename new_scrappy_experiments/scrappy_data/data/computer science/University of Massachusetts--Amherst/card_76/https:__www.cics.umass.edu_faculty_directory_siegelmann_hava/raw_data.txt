Of particular research interest are intelligence vis-a-vis adaptive memory, advanced models of cognition, and evolving, intelligent interfaces for robotics and other intelligent systems. Her studies often involve multi-scale modeling and system level analysis of major disorders such as cancer. The creator of a new field of computer science, Super-Turing computation, Dr. Siegelmann is applying the theory to biological systems and exploring them in connection with a new generation of analog computer.", "College of Information and Computer Sciences  | 140 Governors Dr., Amherst, MA 01003 | (413) 545-2744 | info@cics.umass.edu"]}
