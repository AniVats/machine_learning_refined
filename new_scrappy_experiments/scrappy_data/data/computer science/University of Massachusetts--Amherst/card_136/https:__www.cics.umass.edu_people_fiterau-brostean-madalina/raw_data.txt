My current research revolves around hybrid methods for multimodal data, especially data from the healthcare domain. Ongoing projects: (1) Modeling disease trajectories and forecasting clinical outcomes by integrating multi-resolution, irregularly-sampled time series and images; (2) Weakly-supervised Transfer Learning of Models and Representations; (3) Online Adaptive Policies for Representation Learning.", "College of Information and Computer Sciences  | 140 Governors Dr., Amherst, MA 01003 | (413) 545-2744 | info@cics.umass.edu"]}
