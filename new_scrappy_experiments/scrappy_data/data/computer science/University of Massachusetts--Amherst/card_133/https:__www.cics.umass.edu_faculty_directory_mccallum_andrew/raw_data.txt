He is especially interested in information extraction from the Web, understanding the connections among people and between organizations, expert finding, social network analysis, and mining the scientific literature. Toward this end he and his group develop and employ various methods in statistical machine learning, natural language processing, information retrieval and data mining---tending toward probabilistic approaches and graphical models. He is one of the pioneers in the development of conditional random fields. As a demonstration of his research, his group has created the research paper search engine at Professor McCallum has over 50 research publications spanning machine learning, natural language processing and reinforcement learning. He is the PI on a prestigious NSF Medium ITR grant, and Co-PI on another. In 2004 and 2007, he received the IBM Faculty Partnership award. In 2004, one of his papers won Honorable Mention at AAAI. Prof. McCallum was selected as a UMass Amherst Lilly Teaching Fellow for the 2005-2006 academic year, and received the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics (NSM) Outstanding Faculty Research Award in 2007.
