To this end, Amir's research group combines the development of practical systems with rigorous theoretical analysis, and incorporates techniques from various disciplines such as computer networking, cryptography, and information theory. The specific problems his research group is currently exploring include Internet censorship resistance, network traffic analysis, covert communications, and machine learning security and privacy. Amir's research has found flaws in popular privacy-preserving tools, and has led to the advent of novel designs to overcome these problems.Amir's work has been publicized in the media through interviews, and he has received several awards for his research, including UIUC's Computer Engineering Fellowship award and the Best Practical Paper award of the IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy (Oakland) 2013. Amir has served as a program chair, technical program committee member, and reviewer for various conferences, workshops, and journals in the area of security and privacy.", "College of Information and Computer Sciences  | 140 Governors Dr., Amherst, MA 01003 | (413) 545-2744 | info@cics.umass.edu"]}
