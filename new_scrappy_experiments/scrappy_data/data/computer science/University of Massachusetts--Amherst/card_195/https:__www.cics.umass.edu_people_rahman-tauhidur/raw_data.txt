His research is interdisciplinary and employs core concepts and theories from different domains including applied physics, embedded and mobile computing, signal processing, machine learning, health sciences and medicine. Professor Rahman's long-term research vision is to rethink the core physical mechanisms of existing health technologies and to impact the way we diagnose diseases, track and manage our health.Professor Rahman was a recipient of the Google Ph.D. Fellowship in 2016 in mobile computing. He also received an Outstanding Teaching Award in 2015 from Cornell University. Some of his other notable accomplishments include finalist in Qualcomm innovation fellowship in 2015, one best paper award in ACM Digital Health 2016, one best paper honorable mention award in ACM Ubicomp 2015. He co-chaired the 1st workshop on Digital Biomarkers 2017 (collocated with MobiSys 2017) in Niagara Falls, NY. His research has received several press coverages including Wall Street Journal, NewScientist, MIT Technology Review.", "College of Information and Computer Sciences  | 140 Governors Dr., Amherst, MA 01003 | (413) 545-2744 | info@cics.umass.edu"]}
