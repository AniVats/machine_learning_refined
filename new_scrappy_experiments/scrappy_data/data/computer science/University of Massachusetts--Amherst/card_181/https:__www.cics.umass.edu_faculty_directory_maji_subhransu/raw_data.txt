He is interested in building recognition architectures that are robust and applicable in real-world settings. For example, his research on part-based models called poselets led to several state-of-the-art results on analyzing images containing people. At TTI Chicago, he developed algorithms where humans and machines collaborate to solve difficult learning and inference problems. He actively collaborates with researchers worldwide and has published in the leading computer vision and machine learning conferences.", "College of Information and Computer Sciences  | 140 Governors Dr., Amherst, MA 01003 | (413) 545-2744 | info@cics.umass.edu"]}
