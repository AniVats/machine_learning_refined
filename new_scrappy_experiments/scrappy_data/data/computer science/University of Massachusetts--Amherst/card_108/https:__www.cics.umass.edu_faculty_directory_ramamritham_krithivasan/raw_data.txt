Here, Professor Ramamritham's work aims to enhance the performance and functionality of applications (such as workflows and information retrieval) that require or can benefit from transactional support, by exploiting semantic information about the objects, operations, transaction model, and the application. In the area of real-time databases, Professor Ramamritham's work\u00a0 focuses on integrating active, real-time, temporal and multimedia databases for time-constrained applications. Priority assignment and real-time transaction scheduling in active real-time databases, real-time logging and recovery, temporal consistency and scheduling in temporal databases, and multimedia databases are some of the current topics under investigation.", "College of Information and Computer Sciences  | 140 Governors Dr., Amherst, MA 01003 | (413) 545-2744 | info@cics.umass.edu"]}
