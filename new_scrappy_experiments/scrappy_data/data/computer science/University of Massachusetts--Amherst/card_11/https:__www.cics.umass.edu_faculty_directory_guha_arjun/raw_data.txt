He enjoys tackling real-world problems, while adhering to the mathematical foundations of programming languages. For example, his dissertation on JavaScript semantics and type-checking is used by several other researchers as a foundation for their own work. During his postdoc, he developed a mathematical model of software-defined networking (SDN) and used it to build machine-verified controllers and other tools for SDN. His research has led to several software systems, such as LambdaJS, Frenetic, and Flapjax that are in active use.Ph.D., Computer Science, Brown University (2012), Sc.M., Computer Science, Brown University, (2008), A.B., Computer Science, Grinnell College (2006). Arjun spent 2012\u20132013 as a postdoctoral researcher at Cornell University. In Fall 2013, he joined the College of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst as an Assistant Professor, and was promoted to Associate Professor in 2019.Professor Guha received a best student paper award at OOPSLA 2009, for his work on Flapjax: A Programming Language for Ajax Applications. He serves on the program committees for several conferences on programming languages research.", "College of Information and Computer Sciences  | 140 Governors Dr., Amherst, MA 01003 | (413) 545-2744 | info@cics.umass.edu"]}
