This massive and multi-modal learner and content data can be collected in both traditional classrooms and online learning platforms, e.g., during massive open online courses (MOOCs). His vision is to develop a system that delivers high-quality, affordable, and personalized learning experiences to every learner in the world. He is also broadly interested in areas including convex optimization, probabilistic models, machine learning, and signal processing.\u00a0Prior to joining UMass, Andrew was a postdoctoral research associate in the EDGE Lab, Princeton University, from 2017 to 2018.\u00a0Andrew\u00a0was a postdoctoral research associate in the Digital Signal Processing (DSP) group, Rice University, in 2016, where he received his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Rice University in 2014 and 2016, respectively. \u00a0He also attended the Georgia Institute of Technology as a visiting student in 2009.", "College of Information and Computer Sciences  | 140 Governors Dr., Amherst, MA 01003 | (413) 545-2744 | info@cics.umass.edu"]}
