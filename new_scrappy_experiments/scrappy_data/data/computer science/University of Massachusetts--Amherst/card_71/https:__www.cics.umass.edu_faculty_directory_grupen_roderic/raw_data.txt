His laboratory builds dexterous machines that develop in a manner inspired by infant human development and that write their own programs and knowledge structures. Grupen and his students are currently working on personal robots for health care applications, robots designed to explore other planets, robots that learn how to work along side humans, and field robotics systems. His approach relies on structuring the search for behavior by expressing the intrinsic dynamics of physical processes and acquiring policies for robot control tasks using on-line reinforcement learning. The Laboratory for Perceptual Robotics uses this framework as the basis for a computational model of sensorimotor development in humans and machines.", "College of Information and Computer Sciences  | 140 Governors Dr., Amherst, MA 01003 | (413) 545-2744 | info@cics.umass.edu"]}
