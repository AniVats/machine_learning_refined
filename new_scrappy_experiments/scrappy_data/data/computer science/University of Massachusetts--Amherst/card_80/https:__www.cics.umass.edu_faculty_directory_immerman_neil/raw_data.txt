In a long and continuing series of papers with Tom Reps, Mooly Sagiv, and related students and colleagues, Professor Immerman studies when and how one can reason about reachability, e.g., when one portion of memory is reachable from another via a series of pointers. These methods are used to automatically check the correctness of programs that manipulate data. This aspect of Professor Immerman's research has valuable applications to software including software-defined networks.", "College of Information and Computer Sciences  | 140 Governors Dr., Amherst, MA 01003 | (413) 545-2744 | info@cics.umass.edu"]}
