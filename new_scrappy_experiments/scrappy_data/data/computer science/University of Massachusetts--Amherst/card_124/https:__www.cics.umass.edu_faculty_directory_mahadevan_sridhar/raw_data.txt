His research in machine learning has been eclectic, ranging from pioneering work in explanation-based learning where his thesis introduced the model of learning apprentices for knowledge acquisition from experts, to the first rigorous study of concept learning with prior determination knowledge using the framework of Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning. Over the past decade, his research has centered around a general framework for , which studies how agents embedded in real-world environments can acquire knowledge on how to act from a stream of noisy percepts. \u00a0The framework is rigorously validated using temporal statistical process models, principally Markov decision processes. His recent research has focused on hierarchical probabilistic models, including hierarchical hidden Markov processes, semi-Markov decision processes, and hierarchical partially observable Markov decision processes. Professor Mahadevan has also developed state-of-the-art applications, including mobile robot navigation in indoor office environments, an active vision system for finding objects in cluttered rooms, and coordination among teams of factory agents optimizing production control.", "College of Information and Computer Sciences  | 140 Governors Dr., Amherst, MA 01003 | (413) 545-2744 | info@cics.umass.edu"]}
