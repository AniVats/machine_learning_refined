The ambition of his research is to design fair and representative social computing systems, such as rating systems in social media, predictive models of human decision-making, and recommender systems. Important questions concerning the design of these systems include: how to train non-discriminatory machine learning models and how to prevent biases in social evaluations? Professor Grabowicz studies fairness, social influence, group formation, information diffusion, and information processing using multilevel probabilistic graphical models, information theory, network science, and causal inference.Ph.D., Interdisciplinary Physics, University of Balearic Islands (2013), M.Sc., Applied Physics, Warsaw University of Technology (2008). Professor Grabowicz joined the College of Information and Computer Sciences of the University of Massachusetts Amherst in Fall 2018 as a Research Assistant Professor. Prior to this, from 2013 to 2018, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems in Saarbruecken, Germany.", "College of Information and Computer Sciences  | 140 Governors Dr., Amherst, MA 01003 | (413) 545-2744 | info@cics.umass.edu"]}
