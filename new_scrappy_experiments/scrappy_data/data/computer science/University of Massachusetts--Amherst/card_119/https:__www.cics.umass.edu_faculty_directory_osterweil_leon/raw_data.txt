The focus of most of our research is on the static analysis of concurrent software--the nondeterministic behavior introduced by concurrency means that dynamic analysis (testing) is not adequate for concurrent systems. Since concurrent systems are built of interacting sequential components, however, many of the techniques we use for analyzing concurrent systems can also be applied to sequential software.", "College of Information and Computer Sciences  | 140 Governors Dr., Amherst, MA 01003 | (413) 545-2744 | info@cics.umass.edu"]}
