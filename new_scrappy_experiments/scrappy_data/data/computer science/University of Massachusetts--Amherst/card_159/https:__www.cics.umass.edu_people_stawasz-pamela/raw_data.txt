She loves working with college students and supporting them as they explore their academic and co-curricular interests, develop goals, and prepare for life after college. Her advice to students is \"Get to know lots of people! UMass is a bureaucracy, and very little will be done for you, but there are lots of us here eager to help. You may need to make the first step, though, to reach out and get to know instructors, advisors, and others. Take advantage of as many academic, cultural, social, and experiential (research, internships, study abroad, community engagement, etc.) opportunities as you can. They will truly enhance your education and prepare you best for life after college.\"", "College of Information and Computer Sciences  | 140 Governors Dr., Amherst, MA 01003 | (413) 545-2744 | info@cics.umass.edu"]}
