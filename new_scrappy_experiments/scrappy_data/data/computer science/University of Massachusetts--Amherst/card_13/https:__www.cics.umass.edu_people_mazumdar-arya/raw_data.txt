In general,\u00a0Arya is very much interested in fundamental problems of information theory plus related combinatorial or probabilistic methods. Arya's research in error-correcting codes has produced first efficiently implementable family of codes over permutations, as well as the best known fundamental limits of locally repairable codes.\u00a0", "College of Information and Computer Sciences  | 140 Governors Dr., Amherst, MA 01003 | (413) 545-2744 | info@cics.umass.edu"]}
