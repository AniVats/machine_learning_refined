He is particularly interested in designing algorithms that help people to easily create and process 3D models of objects and animations.Evangelos Kalogerakis obtained his PhD from the department of Computer Science, University of Toronto in September 2010. His PhD introduced machine learning algorithms for geometry processing. He was a postdoctoral researcher at the Computer Graphics lab of Stanford University from 2010 to 2012. He joined the College of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in September 2012.Evangelos Kalogerakis' research is supported by NSF awards and generous donations from Adobe and NVidia corporations. He received the NSERC Alexander Graham fellowship and the international EPFL Dimitris N. Chorafas award for his PhD work. He has served on program committees for Siggraph ASIA, Symposium on Geometry Processing and Eurographics. He co-chaired the SMI 2018 conference. He has published several papers in ACM Siggraph, CVPR, ICCV, UIST, Transactions on Graphics, Eurographics, Computer Graphics Forum, Symposium on Geometry Processing, ACM MobiSys, IEEE Virtual Reality, and Computer-Aided Design.", "College of Information and Computer Sciences  | 140 Governors Dr., Amherst, MA 01003 | (413) 545-2744 | info@cics.umass.edu"]}
